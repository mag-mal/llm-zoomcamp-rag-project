1,Adenium obesum,"Adenium obesum, more commonly known as a desert rose, is a poisonous species of flowering plant belonging to the tribe Nerieae of the subfamily Apocynoideae of the dogbane family, Apocynaceae. It is native to the Sahel regions south of the Sahara (from Mauritania and Senegal to Sudan), tropical and subtropical eastern and southern Africa, as well as the Arabian Peninsula. Other names for the flower include Sabi star, kudu, mock azalea, and impala lily. Adenium obesum is a popular houseplant and bonsai in temperate regions.

","Adenium obesum is a popular houseplant and bonsai in temperate regions. It requires a sunny location and a minimum indoor temperature in winter of 10 °C (50 °F). It thrives on a xeric watering regime as required by cacti. A. obesum is typically propagated by seed or stem cuttings.  The numerous hybrids are propagated mainly by grafting on to seedling rootstock.  While plants grown from seed are more likely to have the swollen caudex at a young age, with time many cutting-grown plants cannot be distinguished from seed-grown plants. Like many plants, Adenium obesum can also be propagated in vitro using plant tissue culture.

2,Adiantum aethiopicum,"Adiantum aethiopicum, also known as the common maidenhair fern, is a small fern of widespread distribution, occurring in Africa, Australia, Norfolk Island and New Zealand.
Adiantum aethiopicum was one of the many species first described by Linnaeus, in this case in his Systema naturae in 1759. The specific epithet aethiopicum in this sense was the Latin term for Africa south of the then known world, that is to say, more or less Africa south of Egypt.
In South Africa the species occurs widely, though not generally profusely, mainly on moist sandstone cliffs in full shade. In the Cape Peninsula it is uncommon and grows mainly at the highest locally available altitudes, generally about 600–1,085 m (2,000–3,600 ft).
Adiantum aethiopicum grows in spreading clumps of fronds from 10 to 45 cm (4 to 18 in) in height. The rhizomes are wiry and branched. The fronds are horizontal and layered, or upright. They are divided into two or three and have many small wedge-shaped segments, each of which has sori along its margins underneath.
A common plant, often seen growing in moist areas. In Australia it is found near by creeks or in open forest, where it may form a large colony.
The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia’ records that ""This plant is said to possess medicinal properties, being
slightly astringent and emetic. It has been used in Europe in making ""Sirop de Capt'llaire,"" a demulcent drink, employed in
diseases of the chest.""","Adiantum aethiopicum is a popular and well known ornamental plant. Propagation is from plant division or by spores. In cultivation the Maidenhair fern prefers a well-lit situation inside, but a shady place outdoors without draughts. It is suitable for terrariums and hanging baskets. It is fairly easy to grow, and will flourish in moist garden soil or potting mix.",No data available
3,Adiantum capillus-veneris,"Adiantum capillus-veneris, the Southern maidenhair fern, black maidenhair fern, maidenhair fern, and venus hair fern,  is a species of ferns in the genus Adiantum and the family Pteridaceae with a subcosmopolitan worldwide distribution. It is cultivated as a popular garden fern and houseplant.","Adiantum capillus-veneris  is cultivated and widely available around the world for planting in natural landscape native plants and traditional shade gardens, for outdoor container gardens, and commonly as an indoor houseplant.
Adiantum × mairisii is a winter hardy hybrid of Adiantum capillus-veneris with another species, which is likely to be one of Adiantum raddianum, Adiantum aethiopicum, or Adiantum cuneatum.
As a houseplant, Adiantum capillus-veneris  requires filtered light and very humid conditions. It should be grown in soil rich in organic matter and should be watered frequently but lightly, to keep the roots damp but not drenched. The temperature should not fall below 12 °C (54 °F). It is propagated by dividing, making sure each clump has a section of rhizome.",No data available
4,Adiantum formosum,"Adiantum formosum, known as the giant maidenhair or black stem maidenhair is a fern found in Australia and New Zealand. It was one of the many species authored by Scottish botanist Robert Brown, appearing in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. Its species name is the Latin adjective formosus ""handsome"" or ""beautiful"".
Adiantum formosum is an attractive plant, with fronds up to 120 cm (48 in) high. The rhizome of this species is unusually deep, up to 60 cm (24 in) below into the earth. The stems are black and can reach 90 cm (36 in) in length, while the fronds or blades are triangular with rectangular segments. The last segment of the frond is irregular and asymmetrical, on a short stem. This maidenhair fern can grow to 2 metres (7 ft) tall. The smallest segments of the fronds are the pinnules, which are wedge-shaped, rectangular or trapezoid. They have 1–10 sori along the margins underneath.
Adiantum formosum is found in Queensland, and New South Wales, and into Victoria, where it is less common. It also occurs in New Zealand. It is often seen growing in moist areas or along streams usually on alluvial soils,  Adiantum formosum is generally found in rainforest or in nearby open eucalyptus forest, where it may form a large colony.
Easy to grow in cultivation, Adiantum formosum makes a good subject for container gardening. It appears to go dormant in cooler months and grow rapidly during the summer. A smaller, variegated form is commercially available and cultivated.

7,Aechmea fasciata,"Aechmea fasciata is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is commonly called the silver vase or urn plant and is native to Brazil. This plant is probably the best known species in this genus, and it is often grown as a houseplant in temperate areas.

","Aechmea fasciata requires partial shade to bright indirect light, and can handle brief periods of early morning sunlight, but should be shielded from the sun during the hottest parts of the day. Excessive sun exposure will cause burning on the foliage and dehydration of the plant; comparatively, reduced sunlight or darker conditions will prevent the plant's characteristic coloration and striping from developing fully, instead reverting to a deeper hue of pastel-green/teal-blue in an effort to photosynthesize effectively in the shade. Less bright indirect light will also limit flowering. As with all bromeliads and epiphytes, Aechmea fasciata requires adequate airflow around the entire plant to stay fresh. 
Over time, the plant’s roots will adhere to the surface provided, and the plant will form a small colony. The gardener simply keeps the ""cup"" or funnels filled with water. This method of cultivation is mostly executed successfully outdoors, rather than indoors, and is best-achieved in appropriate climates, especially maritime or seaside locations where the bromeliad may absorb moisture via fog and marine layer.","Aechmea fasciata, while not lethally poisonous, is listed in the FDA Poisonous Plant Database under the section ""skin-irritating substances in plants"". As bromeliads naturally produce the enzyme and alkaloid bromelain—commonly extracted from pineapples (also a bromeliad) as a supplement and digestive enzyme—, skin contact with the plant's sharp, serrated leaf margins is known to cause contact dermititis, phytophotodermatitis, and contact allergy; typical side effects are a mild, itchy sensation or redness. Therefore leather gloves are recommended when working with bromeliads, for example, arm-length or rose-pruning gloves."
8,Aglaonema,"Aglaonema is a genus of flowering plants in the arum family, Araceae. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and New Guinea. They are known commonly as Chinese evergreens.

","Aglaonema have been grown as luck-bringing ornamental plants in Asia for centuries. They were introduced to the West in 1885, when they were first brought to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. They have been cultivated, hybridized, and bred into a wide array of cultivars. They live in low-light conditions and are popular houseplants.
This mainly tropical genus is known for its intolerance of cold temperatures. Chilling injury can begin at 15 °C (59 °F). The injury manifests in dark, greasy-looking patches on the foliage.
Cultivars have been selected for their shape and size, and especially for the color and pattern of the leaves. Many have white or cream-colored stems. Some have also been developed to tolerate colder temperatures. The most common cultivar is 'Silver Queen', which has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
Most propagation of Aglaonema is done with cuttings and by dividing the basal shoots. Care of the houseplant involves protecting it from cold temperatures and excessive sunlight and removing any inflorescences that develop, which can prolong the life of the plant. It requires moist soil, and while some cultivars require a small amount of fertilizer, plants are easily injured when oversupplemented. Aglaonema are prone to false mites (Brevipalpus californicus). They may also acquire populations of nematodes, such as root-knot nematodes and Pratylenchus species, which cause root lesions. Pathogens include the fungus Myrothecium roridum and bacteria such as Pseudomonas cichorii, Erwinia chrysanthemi, and Xanthomonas campestris, which can all cause leaf spot. Colletotrichum fungi can cause anthracnose.
The NASA Clean Air Study determined that the species modestum of this plant genus was effective at removing common household air toxins formaldehyde and benzene.
Aglaonema plants are poisonous due to calcium oxalate crystals. If ingested they cause irritation of the mucous membranes, and the juice can cause skin irritation and painful rash.",No data available
9,Aglaonema commutatum,"Aglaonema commutatum, the poison dart plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Chinese evergreen genus Aglaonema, family Araceae. It is native to the Philippines and northeastern Sulawesi, and has been introduced to other tropical locales, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, Comoros, the Chagos Archipelago, India, Bangladesh, and the Cook Islands. Its hybrid cultivar 'Silver Queen' (with A. nitidum) has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit as a houseplant.

10,Aglaonema modestum,"Aglaonema modestum, called Chinese evergreen, green-for-ten-thousand-years, and lily of China, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Aglaonema, native to Bangladesh, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and southeast and south-central China. In these areas, it is found in tropical swamps and rainforests.","It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
A. modestum is typically 30–90 cm (1–3 ft) tall and 60–120 cm (2–4 ft) wide. It occasionally produces white spathe-and-spadix flowers that give way to oval-shaped, reddish fruits that are 25–75 mm (1–3 in) long. Its lance-shaped leaves measure 200 mm × 100 mm (8 in × 4 in), and are borne on 300 mm (12 in) stalks that arise from a central growing point.
A. modestum requires a shaded location, and should not be exposed to temperatures below 7 °C (45 °F), which can damage the foliage. It cannot endure direct sunlight and is a good choice for dimly lit rooms. It requires ample moisture except for a very short winter rest period, in which watering can be somewhat reduced. Young plants should be repotted every spring, while mature specimens need be repotted only every two to three years.","This plant contains calcium oxalate crystals which are poisonous to humans, dogs, cats, and horses. If ingested, it may cause severe burning and swelling in the mouth and tongue. Contact with the sap may also cause skin irritation."

","Alocasia plants are cultivated in pots as indoor plants in a substrate of sod, peat, humus and sand (2:2:3:2) with moss or pieces of charcoal added. In spring and summer give a liquid compound fertiliser 2 times a month. Alocasia needs extra light in winter; it grows better with high air humidity. Ambient air humidity is maintained at 80-85%. In spring and summer, the Alocasia needs regular watering and frequent spraying. Multiply by grafting, dividing rhizomes or sowing seeds in spring in a warm place. In winter the temperature needs to be relatively high - not lower than 17 °C for all the species described, in summer the optimum temperature is 21 °C. In domestic conditions, water abundantly during the growing season as soon as the soil surface in the pot dries out, from autumn watering is reduced, and in winter moisten the soil only after a day or two after the top layer of substrate dries out. The soil should not be allowed to dry out, but excessive moisture is also extremely harmful.

35,Angraecum sesquipedale,"Angraecum sesquipedale (), also known as Darwin's orchid, Christmas orchid, Star of Bethlehem orchid, and king of the angraecums, is an epiphytic orchid in the genus Angraecum endemic to Madagascar. The orchid was first discovered by the French botanist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars in 1798, but was not described until 1822. It is noteworthy for its long spur and its association with the naturalist Charles Darwin, who surmised that the flower was pollinated by a then undiscovered moth with a proboscis whose length was unprecedented at the time. Darwin's prediction went unverified for 21 years after his death, until just such a moth was discovered and his conjecture vindicated. The story of its postulated pollinator has come to be seen as one of the celebrated predictions of the theory of evolution.","Angraecum sesquipedale was first brought to the United Kingdom in 1855 to be grown outside of its natural environment by William Ellis. Subsequently, Ellis achieved the first flowering of the plant in cultivation in 1857. Angraecum sesquipedale has been attributed as having a nicer appearance when grown in cultivation than when found in the wild, since wild specimens appear as a long stem surrounded by a few struggling leaves. Additionally, A. sesquipedale is seldom grown in private collections, despite its enormous importance to Darwin's concept of coevolution and subsequently the fields of botany and evolutionary biology.

It is often recommended that A. sesquipedale be grown under warm to intermediate conditions and given as much light as possible without burning the leaves. The choice of growing the plant in intermediate or warm housing conditions can affect the timing of the flowering. In order to stimulate heavy flower production it is important that the light intensity be greatest between September and November. The number of flower spikes present during flowering is dependent on the number of new leaf-pairs formed during the preceding spring and summer, since each newly formed leaf-pair produce one spike and rarely two. Angraecum sesquipedale is commonly found to have a slow growth habit, but the orchid can be expected to produce flowers even before it has reached an adult size. Angraecum sesquipedale is notorious for having sensitive roots. The roots of mature plants are best left undisturbed as much as possible and as a result it is prudent to be especially careful during repotting. Young plants however are less susceptible to such root problems. Disturbing the roots can cause the plant to sulk for two to four years or even to cause it to die. When a mature plant is disturbed it frequently loses many of its lower leaves and reverts to only producing one or two flowers at a time. To avoid these problems it is commonly advised that the orchid be planted in a coarse medium such as fir bark, crock, or charcoal to minimize disturbances to the roots. Also planting it in a basket or large pot is best since this allows the orchid to grow for many years before having to have its roots disturbed.",No data available

The genus is native to the Americas, where it is distributed from northern Mexico to northern Argentina and parts of the Caribbean.

","Like other aroids, many species of Anthurium plant can be grown as houseplants, or outdoors in mild climates in shady spots, including Anthurium crystallinum and Anthurium clarinervium with its large, velvety, dark green leaves and silvery white venation. Many hybrids are derived from Anthurium andraeanum or Anthurium scherzerianum because of their colorful spathes. They thrive in moist soils with high organic matter. In milder climates the plants can be grown in pots of soil. Indoors plants thrive at temperatures of 16–22 °C (61–72 °F) and at lower light than other house plants. Wiping the leaves off with water will remove any dust and insects. Plants in pots with good root systems will benefit from a weak fertilizer solution every other week.  In the case of vining or climbing Anthuriums, the plants benefit from being provided with a totem to climb.","All plants within the Anthurium genus are toxic to cats, dogs, and even horses. Each part of the plant, including the root, stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds, poses a risk of toxicity. The plant contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause oral irritation, pain, swelling, excessive drooling, vomiting, and difficulty swallowing.

51,Asplenium antiquum,"Asplenium antiquum is a species of fern in the family Aspleniaceae. It is sometimes referred to by the common names bird's-nest ferns (also called spleenworts). In Japanese, it is known by ō-tani-watari  and tani-watari. It grows on cliffs, logs and rocks, near waterfalls, in damp forests, and on tree trunks in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. It is classified as an endangered species in both South Korea and Japan.

","Despite its endangered status in Japan and South Korea, Asplenium antiquum is a fairly common ornamental plant within the nursery trade, widely sold throughout Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America. This species may be grown outdoors all year-round in certain temperate and subtropical climates (for example, in sheltered, ventilated areas within USDA hardiness zones 9 and 10); elsewhere, it may live outside from approximately May through October (in the northern hemisphere; about October to March in the southern). However, it must be protected or brought-inside as a house plant when frost is a risk, or when nighttime temperatures drop below 40 °F (4.44 °C). It requires fairly consistent, high humidity—albeit without being so saturated as to induce rot. The ideal substrate should be aerated and well-draining, such as sphagnum moss, while still feeling like a damp, wrung-out sponge. Keep out of direct sunlight while still providing bright, indirect light. A. antiquum does best in a well ventilated but comfortable greenhouse or terrarium setup, if grown indoors, and thrives in semi-hydroponics.

It grows small bulbils on top of its fronds. Once grown to about 5 cm (2.0 in), these offspring fall off and, provided the soil they land in is kept moist, develop a root system and grow into new ferns. This additional means of reproduction can be employed with greater ease than propagation by spores. There are a number of similar Southern Hemisphere species which have a similar mode of reproduction, including Asplenium daucifolium.

For example, B. hygroscopica, also known as the Queensland rock violet in Australia, occurs in Cape York Peninsula and Northeast Queensland as far south as Rockhampton, from 60–900 metres (200–2,950 ft) elevation. It grows along creek beds, on moist banks, moss-covered rocks in rainforest, open forest, vine forest and gallery forest.
Some Boea species are known as types of resurrection plant due to their ability to survive desiccation (e.g. B. hygrometrica and B. hygroscopica).","These cultivation notes are based on B. hygroscopica, a species from Northern Queensland, Australia.
B. hygroscopica grows to about 15 centimetres (6 in), and forms a dense, velvety clump that flowers over many weeks in the warm months.
A well-drained soil is suggested for this plant, achieved by using a potting mix with 20% sand content, and 5mm (~0.2 inches) of scoria or other drainage material in the bottom of the pot. A fertilizer with an NPK ratio of about 13.8:3.2:9.9, plus trace elements, is recommended.

63,Caladium praetermissum,"Caladium () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. They are often known by the common name elephant ear (which they share with the closely related genera Alocasia, Colocasia, and Xanthosoma), heart of Jesus, and angel wings. There are over 1000 named cultivars of Caladium bicolor from the original South American plant.
The genus Caladium includes seven species that are native to South America and Central America, and naturalized in India, parts of Africa, and various tropical islands. They grow in open areas of the forest and on the banks of rivers and go dormant during the dry season. The wild plants grow to 15–35 inches (40–90 cm) tall, with leaves mostly 6-18 inches (15–45 cm) long and broad.","Several species are grown as ornamental plants for their large, arrowhead-shaped leaves marked in varying patterns in white, pink, and red (somewhat resembling the unrelated coleus) and have been in cultivation in Europe since the late 18th century. The two forms most widely cultivated are called ""fancy-leaved"" and ""lance-leaved"". The former is the more commonly seen and is the traditional caladium of cultivation; the leaves are more heart-shaped. The latter has more lance-head-shaped leaves. Most Caladiums in cultivation grow to about 24 inches (60 cm) high and 24 inches (60 cm) wide, although dwarf varieties are now in cultivation.
Numerous cultivars have been selected, most of them derived from C. bicolor. Many are sold as C. × hortulanem, a synonym for C. bicolor. The lance-leaved varieties are also derived from C. schomburgkii.
Caladiums grow from tubers and can be propagated by dividing the tubers. They are hardy only to USDA plant hardiness zone 10; in colder areas, they are typically grown as tender ""bulbs"" or as houseplants.
During their growing season, they require moderate watering (damp, not soggy). Most varieties prefer partial to full shade, although sun-resistant varieties are now in cultivation. Approximately 98% of all caladium ""bulbs"" are from Lake Placid, Florida, in the United States. In recent years, many new varieties have become available through breeding and are now largely disease resistant. The bulk of ""bulb"" production is sold to pot producers, who in turn provide local nursery outlets with potted caladiums ready for immediate planting. Most ""bulb"" growers also sell direct retail via websites, shipping of ""bulbs"" takes place in the spring when temperatures permit (""bulbs"" are subject to damage if temperatures are too low).
In temperate areas, they should be lifted before the first frost. The tubers are dried and stored for the winter when temperatures fall to 65 °F (18 °C), and stored moderately dry (not bone-dry) over the winter at temperatures between 56 °F (13 °C) and 61 °F (16 °C).

Common names include chain of hearts, collar of hearts, string of hearts, rosary vine, hearts-on-a-string, and sweetheart vine.

","Ceropegia woodii is tender and in temperate regions it is a very popular houseplant, often grown in hanging baskets so the long trailing branches may hang down with their leaves spaced out like a row of large beads. Several cultivars have been selected, some with variegated leaves. It requires excellent drainage, should be watered only when dry, and should never stand in water. Excess water should be removed from plant saucer after watering. It can be grown outdoors only in subtropical and tropical areas having a minimum temperature of 15 °C (59 °F).

The parlor palm is one of the most extensively sold houseplant palms in the world. It is one of several species with leaves that are harvested as xate.
This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

","It is often cultivated in temperate regions as a houseplant and in gardens in Southeastern United States, where it grows to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall with very slow growth. It is most-often planted and sold in batches of 5-30 seedlings. Over time, a few emergent plants begin to dominate as the weaker/smaller seedlings are crowded out for light and eventually die, leaving within a few years of purchase a few survivors which develop stems and can live for many decades in a pot. It tolerates low levels of humidity and light, though it prefers medium to high humidity and bright indirect light. Chamaedorea elegans is intolerant of frost and must be kept indoors in winter in non-tropical climates.
It enjoys light potting soil, good humidity and moderate lighting without direct sunlight, but it accommodates a certain dryness, high humidity or reduced lighting. In winter, it is preferable that the temperature of the room it's housed in does not exceed 12–14 °C (53+1⁄2–57 °F). The plant was successful in the Victorian era because it survived in the dark and often unheated British homes of the time, and in greenhouses which were used to grow and cultivate exotic plants, a practice fashionable at the time.
Propagation is done only by sowing.
In its natural rain-forest floor setting, the parlor palm often grows in competition with vines. It sometimes is seen growing along rock walls, which can provide support. Due to the thinness of the stem, in nature the palm sometimes falls over during storms if grown in the open. The rhizomatic roots can re-root from a fallen position in mature plants, if it has grown adventitious roots.
In a potted environment, pruning can be done with mature plants from the bottom only (cutting the top off is fatal) and only if adventitious roots are available. As the stem grows additional roots, the bottom of the stem can be severed and the plant re-rooted from the roots higher up the stem.",No data available

Croton variegatum L.) is a species of Codiaeum, a genus of flowering plants, in the  Euphorbiaceae (the spurge family). Initially described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, it is native to Australasia and Oceania, from Malaysia and Indonesia in the north through northeastern Australia, as well as many Southeast Asian and South Pacific islands, growing in open forests and scrub. 
The Codiaeums' commonly used name of ""croton"" should not be confused with Croton, a separate genus—also within the Euphorbiaceae—which contains more than 700 species of cosmopolitan herbs, shrubs, and trees.","In tropical climates, crotons make attractive hedges and potted patio specimens, valued for their striking foliage. They only survive outdoors where temperatures do not normally drop below 10 to 13 °C (50 to 55 °F) in winter; colder temperatures can cause leaf loss. In colder climates, the plants are grown in greenhouses or as house plants. The cultivated garden crotons are usually smaller than the wild plant, rarely over 1.8 m (5.9 ft) tall, and occur in a wide diversity of leaf shapes and colours. They are sometimes grouped under the name Codiaeum variegatum var. pictum (Lodd.) Müll. Arg., though this is not botanically distinct from the species and usually treated as a synonym of it.","As with the majority of the spurges, when broken or cut, every part of C. variegatum will ""bleed"" and drip a milky, caustic sap, eventually drying into a latex-like consistency. Care must be taken to avoid touching this latex, such as only handling the plant while wearing sufficiently protective gloves, as well as eye goggles or sunglasses. Generally, small, inadvertent drops of the sap on one's hands or skin will cause no ill effect in the majority of the population, provided it is promptly washed off using soapy, warm water—this may even be followed with the use of a hand sanitizer or even a mildly diluted isopropyl alcohol. However, direct contact between the sap of Euphorbiaceae and the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, genitals, or any open wound, is strongly discouraged and may result in unknown side effects. Complications stemming from sap contact may range from mild to extreme burning pain, itchiness, rash or temporary dulling of the senses; depending on the region of the body affected, this sensory reaction may include temporary or long-term complications with sight, hearing, taste, feeling or smell, among other issues. In certain sensitive-skinned individuals, contact with small amounts of the sap can cause contact dermatitis. The entire plant, including its bark, roots, inflorescences and foliage, is poisonous. The primary alkaloid present is the chemical compound 5-desoxyingenol.  The plant contains an oil which is violently purgative and a suspected carcinogen.  Consumption of the seeds can be fatal to children and even adults."
77,Coleus scutellarioides,"Coleus scutellarioides, commonly known as coleus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae (the mint or deadnettle family), native to southeast Asia through to Australia. Typically growing to 60–75 cm (24–30 in) tall and wide, it is a bushy, woody-based evergreen perennial, widely grown for the highly decorative variegated leaves found in cultivated varieties. 
Another common name is painted nettle, reflecting its relationship to deadnettles (Lamium species), which are in the same family. (True nettles and their close kin are in the distant family Urticaceae.) The synonyms Coleus blumei, Plectranthus scutellarioides and Solenostemon scutellarioides are also widely used for this species.

78,Colocasia fallax,"Colocasia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Some species are widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical and subtropical regions.
The names elephant-ear and cocoyam are also used for some other large-leaved genera in the Araceae, notably Xanthosoma and Caladium. The generic name is derived from the ancient Greek word kolokasion, which in the Koine Greek of the 1st century botanist Pedanius Dioscorides may have meant the edible roots of both taro (C. esculenta) and Nelumbo nucifera.
The species Colocasia esculenta is invasive in wetlands along the Gulf Coast of the United States, where it threatens to displace native wetland plants.","C. esculenta and other members of the genus are cultivated as ornamental plants, or for their edible corms, a traditional starch staple in many tropical areas.
The plant can be grown in the ground or in large containers. They are grown outside year-round in subtropical and tropical areas. In temperate regions, they are planted out for the summer and dug up and stored over winter, dry and with ventilation to prevent fungal infection. They can be grown in almost any temperature zone as long as the summer is warm. Growth is best at temperatures between 20 and 30 °C (68 and 86 °F). The plants can be damaged if temperatures fall below 10 °C (50 °F) for more than a few days.
The root tuber is typically planted close to the surface. The first signs of growth will appear in 1 to 3 weeks. The adult plant will need a minimum of at least 1 m2 (11 sq ft) of space for good growth. They do best in compost-rich soil and in shade, but will grow reasonably well in average soil provided it is moisture-retentive. The plants should not be left to go dry for too long; if this does happen, the leaves will wilt; watering will allow the plant to recover if done before they get too dry. Periodic fertilisation (every 3 to 4 weeks) with a common plant fertiliser will increase yields.",No data available
79,Cordyline fruticosa,"Cordyline fruticosa is an evergreen flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is known by a wide variety of common names, including ti plant, palm lily, and cabbage palm.
The plant has been cultivated in Asia and Oceania, with a number of uses including food and traditional medicine. It is of great cultural importance to the traditional inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and Maritime Southeast Asia.

","Its original native distribution is unknown, but it is believed to be native to the region from Bangladesh, to Mainland Southeast Asia, South China, Taiwan, Maritime Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Northern Australia. It has the highest morphological diversity in New Guinea and is believed to have been extensively cultivated there.
It was carried throughout Oceania by Austronesians, reaching as far as Hawaii, New Zealand (including the Kermadec Islands), and Easter Island at their furthest extent. A particularly important type of ti in eastern Polynesia is a large green-leafed cultivar grown for their enlarged edible rhizomes. Unlike the ti populations in Southeast Asia and Near Oceania, this cultivar is almost entirely sterile in the further islands of eastern Polynesia. It can be propagated only by cuttings from the stalks or the rhizomes. It is speculated that this was the result of deliberate artificial selection, probably because they produce larger and less fibrous rhizomes more suitable for use as food.
It was introduced to Europe as a houseplant in 1771.",No data available
80,Crassula arborescens,"Crassula arborescens—the silver jade plant, silver dollar (jade) plant, beestebul, Chinese jade, cookie plant, money plant, or money tree, that is endemic to Western Cape,  South Africa,  is a species of succulent plant in the family Crassulaceae.","It is cultivated as an ornamental plant for use in drought tolerant and succulent gardens, and in container gardens. It is also suitable for growing indoors as a houseplant if provided with full-exposure, sunny windows or grow lights, to prevent etiolation.",No data available
81,Crassula muscosa,"Crassula muscosa,  synonyms Crassula lycopodioides and Crassula pseudolycopodioides, is a succulent plant native to South Africa and Namibia, belonging to the family Crassulaceae and to the genus Crassula. It is a houseplant grown worldwide and commonly known as rattail crassula, watch chain, lizard's tail, zipper plant and princess pines.

","During the cold season, it tolerates temperature drops up to a minimum of 6-8°C, requiring little water. In summer, it needs a lot more water and should be not exposed to full sun, as it suffers under excessive sunlight. When these conditions are not met the plant begins to dry and stiffen, generally starting from the base of the stem up to the tips. It is an invasive species and easily propagated from stem cuttings. If the environment maintains a stable temperature of 20-21°C, with adequate humidity and brightness, the cutting will root and grow rapidly.",No data available
82,Crassula ovata,"Crassula ovata, commonly known as jade plant, lucky plant, money plant or money tree, is a succulent plant with small pink or white flowers that is native to the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, and Mozambique; it is common as a houseplant worldwide. Much of its popularity stems from the low levels of care needed; the jade plant requires little water and can survive in most indoor conditions. It is sometimes referred to as the money tree; however, Pachira aquatica also has this nickname.

","As a succulent, Crassula ovata requires little water in the summer and even less in the winter. It is susceptible to overwatering, especially during the cold season. Watering excessively can cause leaf fall and root rot. However, a lack of water can also damage it. It should be grown in a porous substrate with good drainage, which will vary depending on the climate it is grown in. It requires four to six hours of direct sun or medium shade exposures with bright light per day. In regions with mild weather it can withstand some light frost provided that the substrate is kept dry.
C. ovata may display a red tinge around its leaves when grown in bright sunlight. In more extreme cases the green colour of the plant is lost and may be replaced by yellow. This is caused by the jade plant making pigments such as carotenoids to protect it from harsh sunlight and ultraviolet rays. The plant also flowers in the winter, particularly during a cooler, darker, dry spell. C. ovata is sometimes attacked by mealybugs, a common nuisance of the succulents.","Some sources claim that some species from the Crassulaceae family, including the jade plant, are toxic to horses, cats and dogs, as well as mildly toxic to humans with skin contact, but such claims remain unproven. Crassula ovata is known to be used as medicinal plant in some regions."

91,Cyrtomium falcatum,"Cyrtomium falcatum is a species of fern, commonly known as house holly-fern and Japanese holly fern, in the wood fern family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to eastern Asia.
It grows from crevices in coastal cliffs, stream banks, rocky slopes, and other moist, stable areas.

","Cyrtomium falcatum is a fairly common outdoor ornamental plant in temperate climates (zones 7 to 10), such as in the coastal counties of California; it is more common as an indoor houseplant in areas with very cold or hot conditions. The holly fern is reliably hardy compared to many other, more tropical species of fern; outdoors, it thrives in locations of low indirect light to deep shade, such as underneath trees or bushes. It may be propagated by spores, but is more commonly multiplied via rhizome division, rooting the fresh cuttings in a substrate of coconut fiber, sphagnum moss, or another well-aerated substrate. The cuttings should be kept evenly moist and shaded but not sitting in a pool of water.
Holly ferns planted either in containers or in the ground are not picky about soil composition or quality; like other ferns, they will even grow mounted or tied to driftwood, wooden boards, tree branches or rocks, provided there is some amount of sphagnum moss or other organic medium surrounding the rhizome and rootball and the plant receives adequate water. While soil quality is not of utmost importance, good drainage and aeration, combined with sufficient moisture retention, is a must. Fertilization is not required, as they are minimal feeders; however, a yearly or twice-yearly application of granular, time-released plant feed may be beneficial.
The holly fern plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
The holly fern has escaped from cultivation in some regions of the world, and has become established in the wild as an introduced species. It can now be found in much of Mediterranean Europe, North America, the Atlantic Islands, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. It is classified as a weed in most of Australia.",No data available

93,Delosperma lehmannii,"Delosperma lehmannii is a succulent plant native to parts of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Sometimes called ice plant, it is grown as a decorative houseplant for its distinctive smooth, angular leaves. The specific epithet lehmannii honors the German professor of botany in Hamburg Johann Georg Christian Lehmann.
Delosperma lehmannii grows in the eastern coastal strip of the Cape Peninsula over an area of about 70 km2 between Coega and Port Elizabeth.
It grows on quartz soils in the Karoo. It tolerates aridity well and temperatures down to -5 °. Densely leafy, it forms a cushion with a tap root and some additional adventitious roots on sprawling, prostrate stems.
Although it has not yet been subjected to an evaluation by the IUCN, the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) has classified it as a species at extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. In 2006, of the six registered populations, four were extinct due to the urban expansion of Port Elizabeth; in one of the remaining sub-populations near Coega over 60% of the habitat had been lost to mining.

95,Dieffenbachia plant,"Dieffenbachia , commonly known as dumb cane or leopard lily, is a genus of tropical flowering plants  in the family Araceae. It is native to the New World Tropics from Mexico and the West Indies south to Argentina. Some species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, especially as houseplants, and have become naturalized on a few tropical islands.
Dieffenbachia is a perennial herbaceous plant with straight stem, simple and alternate leaves containing white spots and flecks, making it attractive as indoor foliage. Species in this genus are popular as houseplants because of their tolerance of shade. The English names, dumb cane and mother-in-law's tongue (also used for Sansevieria species) refer to the poisoning effect of raphides, which can cause temporary inability to speak. Dieffenbachia was named by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott, director of the Botanical Gardens in Vienna, to honor his head gardener Joseph Dieffenbach (1790–1863).","With a minimum temperature of 5 °C (41 °F), dieffenbachia must be grown indoors in temperate areas. They need light, but filtered sunlight through a window is usually sufficient. They also need moderately moist soil, which should be regularly fertilized with an appropriate houseplant fertilizer. Leaves will periodically roll up and fall off to make way for new leaves. Yellowing of the leaves is generally a sign of problematic conditions, such as a nutrient deficiency in the soil. Dieffenbachia respond well to hot temperatures and dry climates.
Dieffenbachia prefer medium sunlight, moderately dry soil and average home temperatures of 62–80 °F (17–27 °C). Most require water about twice a week.
As Dieffenbachia seguine comes from the tropical rain forest, it prefers to have moisture at its roots, as it grows all the time, it needs constant water, but with loose well aerated soils.
The cultivars 'Camille'  and 'Tropic Snow' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.","The cells of the Dieffenbachia plant contain needle-shaped calcium oxalate crystals called raphides. If a leaf is chewed, these crystals can cause a temporary burning sensation and erythema.  In rare cases, edema of tissues exposed to the plant has been reported.  Mastication and ingestion generally result in only mild symptoms. With both children and pets, contact with Dieffenbachia (typically from chewing) can cause a host of unpleasant symptoms, including intense numbing, oral irritation, excessive drooling, and localized swelling.  However, these effects are rarely life-threatening. In most cases, symptoms are mild, and can be successfully treated with analgesic agents, antihistamines, or medical charcoal. 
Severe cases can occur if Dieffenbachia makes prolonged contact with oral mucosal tissue. In such cases, symptoms generally include severe pain which can last for several days to weeks. Hospitalization may be necessary if prolonged contact is made with the throat, in which severe swelling has the potential to affect breathing. 
Gastric evacuation or lavage is seldom indicated. In patients with exposure to toxic plants, 70% are children younger than 5 years.
Stories that Dieffenbachia is a deadly poison are urban legends."

99,Dracaena angolensis,"Dracaena angolensis (synonym Sansevieria cylindrica), commonly known as African spear or the spear sansevieria, is a succulent plant native to Angola in Southern Africa. For years, it was placed within the genus Sansevieria (snake-plants), a specific name which is still used synonymously by some; in the 21st century, Sansevieria became part of Dracaena (dragon-trees), after improved testing methods, physical comparisons, and other analyses found sufficient commonalities between the two genera to warrant subsumption.
The genus Dracaena is a part of the Asparagaceae (asparagus family)—i.e., they are closely aligned with and related to such groups as the Asparagus, Agave, Beaucarnea (ponytail ""palms""), Chlorophytum (spider-plants), Camassia, Dasylirion (sotols), Hesperaloe (Texan or red yuccas) and Yucca (Joshua trees).","The species is drought-tolerant and in cultivation requires water only about once every other week during the growing season. The species can be watered once a month during the winter months. The species was described by Wenceslas Bojer in 1837. Dracaena angolensis (under the synonym Sansevieria cylindrica) received its common name from a competition in a Dutch national newspaper. It is popular as an ornamental plant as it is easy to culture and take care of in a home if given bright sunlight and other required resources.  In Brazil, where it is known as lança de São Jorge (""St. George's spear""), it is grown outside houses to ward off evil that might harm the home. The plant plays an important part in the Afro-Brazilian syncretic religion Umbanda, representing the orisha Ogum, as Ogum is syncretized with St. George.",No data available

It is suited to frost-free climates and USDA Hardiness zones 10-11. Elsewhere, it is primarily popular as a houseplant and valued for its tolerance of a wide range of indoor conditions, from bright indirect light, to bright shade (which brings out more variegation in certain hybrids) and even deep shade (where it will have a darker green color). It is also very tolerant of neglect. The NASA Clean Air Study indicated that the plant aided removal of indoor pollutants such as formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene; however, these results were not applicable to typical buildings, where outdoor-to-indoor air exchange already removes volatile organic compounds at a rate that could only be matched by the placement of 10–1000 plants/m2 of a building's floor space.

It can be enjoyed as a specimen plant, accent, or pruned to create a border. Several cultivars have been selected, particularly variegated clones with cream and yellow-green margins. It performs well as a houseplant, tolerating infrequent waterings. It prefers bright, filtered light, without direct sun exposure, restricted outdoors to zones 10–11. It has average water needs and should be fertilized bi-weekly when actively growing. Although it can survive in relatively low light levels, the plant may grow spindly if given insufficient light. When grown indoors, temperatures of 18 to 25 °C (64 to 77 °F) should be maintained. It can be propagated via herbaceous stem cuttings.

108,Dracaena sanderiana,"Dracaena sanderiana is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to Central Africa. It was named after the German–English gardener Henry Frederick Conrad Sander (1847–1920). The plant is commonly marketed as ""lucky bamboo,"" which has become one of its common names, although it is not a species of bamboo.","Dracaena sanderiana and its related varieties are popular houseplants. It is a suitable plant for confined spaces, and it does very well in indirect sunlight or partial shade as direct sunlight often causes its leaves to burn or yellow. The ideal temperature range for D. sanderiana is from 16 to 27 °C (61 to 81 °F). It requires average warmth, adequate light, and regular watering with dry periods in between if planted in soil. It tolerates dry air, but because it is a tropical plant, it does best in higher humidity areas or when given regular mistings. When planted indoors, it stays a smaller, more compact size while growing upwards, leading to its bamboo-like appearance. In contrast, if planted in the ground, it loses its bamboo-like look and it would fill with a leaf-like shape like other dragon trees. When it comes to light, lucky bamboo prefers bright, filtered sunlight, such as what is found under a rainforest canopy. Avoid direct sunlight as it will scorch the leaves.

Until 2017, it was known under the synonym Sansevieria trifasciata. This plant is often kept as a houseplant due to its non-demanding maintenance; they can survive with very little water and sun.","Like other members of its genus, D. trifasciata yields bowstring hemp, a strong plant fiber once used to make bowstrings.
It is now used predominantly as an ornamental plant, outdoors in warmer climates, and indoors as a houseplant in cooler climates. It is popular as a houseplant because it is tolerant of low light levels and irregular watering; during winter, it needs only one watering every couple of months. It will rot easily if overwatered. It is commonly recommended to beginners interested in cultivating houseplants for its easy care.
The NASA Clean Air Study found D. trifasciata has the potential to filter indoor air, removing four of the five main toxins involved in the effects of sick building syndrome. However, its rate of filtration is too slow for practical indoor use.
It can be propagated by cuttings or by dividing the rhizome. The first method has the disadvantage that the variegation will be lost.

D. trifasciata is considered by some authorities a potential weed in Australia. It is widely used as an ornamental in the tropics outdoors in pots and garden beds, and in temperate areas as an indoor plant.

The plant has a number of common names including golden pothos, Ceylon creeper, hunter's robe, ivy arum, silver vine, Solomon Islands ivy, and taro vine. It is also called devil's vine or devil's ivy because it is very hardy and stays green even when kept in the dark. It is sometimes simply labelled Pothos, or mistakenly labelled as a Philodendron or Scindapsus in plant stores. It is commonly known as a money plant in many parts of Indian subcontinent. It rarely flowers without artificial hormone supplements; one of the last known spontaneous flowerings in cultivation was reported in 1964. An amateur grower discovered a flowering Epipremnum aureum in 2023. 
The plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.","In temperate regions, it is a popular houseplant with numerous cultivars selected for leaves with white, yellow, or light green variegation. It is often used in decorative displays in shopping centers, offices, and other public locations largely because it requires little care and is also attractively leafy. In tropical countries, it is found in many parks and gardens, and tends to grow naturally.
As an indoor plant it can reach more than 2 metres (2 yd) in height if given the adequate support (a trellis or moss pole to climb), but hardly develops adult-sized leaves. The best results are achieved by providing indirect light; it tolerates an intense luminosity, but long periods of direct sunlight burn the leaves. It lives well with a temperature between 17 and 30 °C (63 and 86 °F). Generally, the plant will only need watering when the soil feels dry to the touch (typically once every one to two weeks). The plant should be fertilized every 2-3 months during its growing season, and at a reduced rate the rest of the year. It should be replanted at least every 1-2 years, or sooner if it becomes too root-bound. However, it is a very robust plant, and will survive bad growing conditions. The plant grows rapidly in hydroponic culture.
It can be cultivated from a cutting, however, this can carry various diseases such as Erwinia leaf spot, Pythium root rot, Rhizoctonia root rot (Rhizoctonia foot rot), Pseudomonas leaf spot, Southern blight, and Xanthomonas blight.
The plant can remove indoor pollutants such as formaldehyde, trichloroethene, toluene, xylene, and benzene in controlled circumstances (e.g. a sealed room). A study found that this effect declined as the molecular weight of the polluting substance increased.
The plant is sometimes used in aquariums, placed on top of the aquarium, and allowed to grow roots in the water. This is beneficial to the plant and the aquarium as it absorbs nitrates, using them for growth.","The plant is listed as toxic to cats and dogs by the ASPCA, because of the presence of insoluble raphides. Care should be taken to ensure the plant is not consumed by pets.  Symptoms may include oral irritation, vomiting, and difficulty in swallowing.
Due to the calcium oxalate within the plant, it can be mildly toxic to humans as well. Possible side effects from the consumption of E. aureum are atopic dermatitis (eczema) as well as burning and/or swelling of the region inside of and surrounding the mouth. Excessive contact with the plant can also lead to general skin irritation or contact dermatitis."
115,Epipremnum pinnatum,"Epipremnum pinnatum is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It has many common names, including centipede tongavine, taro vine, silver vine and dragon-tail plant. In the Philippines, it is known in Tagalog as tibatib. 
Epipremnum pinnatum starts life on the ground and climbs up trees in its natural forest environment, transitioning to an epiphytic lifestyle over time. It exhibits foliage dimorphism, where juvenile leaves look different from mature leaves of the same plant. 

","The plant has been kept as a houseplant or garden plant for ornamental purposes. Its leaves possess an aesthetic value, and the plant can be hardy in most indoor conditions. In a flower pot, or at a smaller size, its growth is similar to many vining plants, following a drooping, creeping pattern. Aerial roots will dot the stem. Instead of letting the plant hang, some gardeners prefer to add a small lattice or climbing pole for the plant, which would allow it to climb into a more visually interesting shape. 
In a pot, the plant needs water retaining, porous soil. Many commercially available houseplant or tropical garden soil mixes will suffice. The plant is not entirely drought resistant, and needs the soil it's rooted in to be watered weekly, or more frequently in a bigger pot. So long as the soil is allowed to partially or fully dry a couple inches down between waterings. It helps to provide good drainage to the pot, as standing water can damage the plant's roots.",No data available

Specimens in India are among the largest trees in the world by canopy coverage. It is also known as a ""strangler fig"" because like many other trees in the genus Ficus it starts out as epiphyte, that is, leaning on another tree that it ends up suffocating.",No data available,No data available
120,Ficus benjamina,"Ficus benjamina, commonly known as weeping fig, benjamin fig or ficus tree and often sold in stores as just ficus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae, native to Asia and Australia. It is the official tree of Bangkok. The species is also naturalized in the West Indies and in the states of Florida and Arizona in the United States. Its small fruit are favored by some birds. Ficus trees have proved to have environmental benefits in urban areas, such as acting as biomonitors. The species is also associated with some allergens.   

","In tropical, subtropical and warm temperate latitudes, the weeping fig makes a very large and stately tree for parks and other urban situations, such as wide roads. It is often cultivated for this purpose, such as in Bourbong Street Weeping Figs in Bundaberg, where it is heritage listed. 
F. benjamina is a very popular houseplant in temperate areas because of its elegant growth and tolerance of poor growing conditions; it does best in bright, sunny conditions, but it also tolerates considerable shade. It requires a moderate amount of watering in summer and only enough to keep it from drying out in the winter. Longer days, rather high daytime and moderate night-time temperatures constitute favorable conditions for appreciable growth in a short time. It does not need to be misted. The plant is sensitive to cold and should be protected from strong drafts. When grown indoors, it can grow too large for its location and may need drastic pruning or replacement. F. benjamina has been shown effectively to remove gaseous formaldehyde from indoor air. F. benjamina also helps eliminate heavy metals, most commonly in urban areas. The plant has been used as a biomonitor in New Mexico.  
Figs tend to be consumed dried. The fruit is edible, but the species is not usually grown for its fruit. The leaves have been known to have pharmaceutical benefits such as anti-oxidant properties. The leaves are very sensitive to small changes in light. When a tree is turned around or relocated, it reacts by dropping many of its leaves and replacing them with new leaves adapted to the new light intensity. The plant is also sensitive to changes in other environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and relocation (citation needed).",No data available

","It is a popular ornamental tree in subtropical and tropical gardens, and is also grown as a houseplant in temperate areas, where it usually stays shorter and fails to flower or fruit. It requires direct natural light. It is hardy down to 10 °C (50 °F), so specimens may be placed outside during warm periods.",No data available
123,Ficus pumila,"Ficus pumila, commonly known as the creeping fig or climbing fig, is a species of flowering plant in the  mulberry family, native to East Asia (China, Japan, Vietnam) and naturalized in parts of the southeastern and south-central United States. It is also found in cultivation as a houseplant. The Latin specific epithet pumila means ""dwarf"", and refers to the very small leaves of the plant.

","As the common name, ""creeping fig"" indicates, the plant has a creeping/vining habit and is often used in gardens and landscapes where it covers the ground and climbs up trees and walls. It is hardy down to 1 °C (34 °F) and does not tolerate frost. Therefore in temperate regions it is often seen as a houseplant. It is fast-growing and requires little in the way of care. It can be invasive when environmental conditions are favorable. Its secondary roots or tendrils can cause structural damage to certain buildings with fragile mortar or structures made of fragile materials.
It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
The plant requires the fig wasp Blastophaga pumilae for pollination, and is fed upon by larvae of the butterfly Marpesia petreus.","Like other plant species in the family Moraceae, contact with the milky sap of Ficus pumila can cause phytophotodermatitis, a potentially serious skin inflammation. Although the plant is not poisonous per se, F. pumila is listed in the FDA Database of Poisonous Plants."
124,Fittonia albivenis,"Fittonia albivenis is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae, native to the rainforests of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and northern Brazil. An evergreen perennial, it is notable for its dark green foliage with strongly contrasting white or red veins. It is commonly called nerve plant or mosaic plant. In temperate regions where the temperature falls below 10 °C (50 °F) it must be grown as a houseplant.

","The species is used as an ornamental plant that requires fertile soils or substrates based on peat. It is best kept in a moist area with mild sunlight, although it does not demand much light, and temperatures above 55 °F (13 °C). As such, in temperate locations it must be kept under glass as a houseplant.
It must be watered regularly. Without water for a few days, it is known to ""faint"" but is easily revived with a quick watering and resumes its healthiness. Fittonia albivenis is known to be hard to grow, so it is best bought at a nursery then cared for. Its spreading habit makes it ideal as groundcover.
Numerous cultivars have been selected, falling into two cultivar groups, the Argyroneura Group (formerly F. argyroneura, F. verschaffeltii var. argyroneura) with silver to white veins, and the Verschaffeltii Group (formerly F. verschaffeltii) with pink to red veins, both of which have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.",No data available
125,Fittonia gigantea,"Fittonia (or nerve plant or mosaic plant) is a genus of evergreen perennial flowering plants in the acanthus ('bear’s britches') family, Acanthaceae. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical forested areas in northern and western South America, mainly Perú.
The most commonly cultivated species is F. albivenis and its range of  cultivars. They are low-lying, forest floor plants, typically only growing between 10–15 cm (4–6 in) tall, without the 5-10 cm (1-4 in) tall flower stalks. The main feature of the species is its lush, green foliage, streaked with veins of white to deep pink, depending on cultivar; this veining earns the plant its common name of 'Nerve-Plant', as the ""network"" of vessels appears to resemble the layout of a nervous system. The plants also possess a short fuzz on their stems, like other acanthus family genera. Small buds may appear after a time where the stem splits into leaves. 
With a spreading growth habit making it ideal as a shaded garden groundcover, Fittonia can easily be propagated by taking cuttings or by pruning the growing tips. These fresh clippings will regrow roots simply by placing the cut ends in a vessel of water in a bright, albeit indirectly-lit, location. Optionally, this method of ""water-propagation"" may be avoided altogether, as most cuttings may be placed directly into moist substrate, such as sphagnum moss, perlite, coconut (coco) fiber, well-aerated soil, or even LECA (hydroton clay balls). As most plant species will do after being pruned, the trimmed section(s) of the mother plant will be triggered to grow new leaves in a matter of weeks. 
The flowers are rather small, appearing on angular-sided bloom spikes, with a white to off-white colour. Fittonia inflorescences are quite reminiscent of those of the related genus Hypoestes (polka-dot plants); additionally, like the Hypoestes, Fittonia are best kept in a moist area with mild, indirect but bright sunlight, or under screening outdoors in appropriate climates. They thrive in ambient temperatures above 55 °F (13 °C), thus, in temperate areas, they must be grown as houseplants. Notoriously thirsty plants, Fittonia (and Hypoestes) are known to ""faint"" or wilt when the top layer of substrate begins to dry, but is quickly revived with watering. The plants respond especially well to ""bottom watering"", or by submerging a potted specimen in a tray of water instead of pouring water from above. This has the added benefit of keeping the leaves free of water droplets or splashed dirt, which could both lead to fungal infections, such as powdery mildew.

145,Huernia macrocarpa,"The genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of perennial, stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa and Arabia, first described as a genus in 1810.
The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown. To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.
The name of the plant is in honor of Justus van Heurne (1587–1653?) a Dutch missionary, botanist, and doctor, who is reputed to have been the first European to document and collect South African Cape plants. His surname has variations (van Horne, Heurnius, van Heurnius), however it was misspelled by the plant collector.
Various species of Huernia are considered famine food by the inhabitants of Konso special woreda in southern Ethiopia. The local inhabitants, who call the native species of this genus baqibaqa indiscriminately, eat it with prepared balls of sorghum (kurkufa); they note that baqibaqa tastes relatively good and has no unpleasant side-effects when boiled and consumed.

148,Jatropha podagrica,"Jatropha podagrica is a species of flowering, caudiciform succulent plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, aligning it closely with related genera such as Croton, Euphorbia and Ricinus (castor bean), among others. It is native to the neotropics of Central America and southern Mexico, but is grown as an ornamental plant in many parts of the world due to its unusual appearance and mature caudex development. Common names for the species include gout-plant, gout-stalk, Guatemalan rhubarb, coral-plant, Buddha-belly plant, purging-nut, physic-nut, goutystalk nettlespurge, Australian bottleplant (a geographical misnomer) and tartogo.","The swollen caudex, showy leaves, and colourful flowers make J. podagrica an attractive ornamental, and it is grown as an indoor plant in many parts of the world.","All parts of the plant are considered toxic, in particular the seeds. The main toxins are a purgative oil and a phytotoxin or toxalbumin (curcin) similar to ricin in Ricinis."
149,Justicia brandegeeana,"Justicia brandegeeana, the Mexican shrimp plant, shrimp plant or false hop, is an evergreen shrub in the genus Justicia of the acanthus family Acanthaceae, native to Mexico, and also naturalized in Florida.
It grows to 1 m tall (rarely more) with spindly limbs. The leaves are oval, green, 3–7.5 cm long. The flowers are white, extending from red bracts which look somewhat like shrimps, hence the common name ""shrimp flower"".
The specific epithet is named for the American botanist Townshend Stith Brandegee (1843–1925). It is sometimes misspelled ""brandegeana"".

","The shrimp plant thrives in the shade in tropical areas. It does best in well-drained sandy or loamy soil, but is generally low maintenance and drought-tolerant.  As it dislikes temperatures below 7 °C (45 °F), in cooler temperate areas it is best grown under glass, where it is excellent as a potted houseplant, owing to its ability to tolerate low light and some neglect. Fertilization is not required.
The shape is generally long and spindly.  If trimmed back regularly, it can maintain a bushy habit and will not need support.  If the branches are allowed to grow long, they will become unable to support themselves and sag towards the ground.
Numerous cultivars are available, with different flower bract colors, including yellow, pink and dark brick-red.
It can be propagated by stem cuttings.
This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
In terms of maintenance, if Justicia brandegeeana is not kept well trimmed it can become a messy shrub. Also, if left alone can grow over 24 inches tall. It therefore requires trimming back annually if it is to hold its shape and retain a desirable size. This shrub is expected to last for 10 to 20 years.",No data available

151,Kalanchoe daigremontiana,"Kalanchoe daigremontiana, formerly known as Bryophyllum daigremontianum and commonly called mother of thousands, alligator plant or Mexican hat plant, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. Like other members of Bryophyllum (now included in the genus Kalanchoe), it can propagate vegetatively from plantlets that develop on its leaf margins, as well as through upshoots from lateral roots, and seeds. All parts of this species contain a very toxic steroid known as daigremontianin.
It is often confused with Kalanchoe laetivirens, Kalanchoe delagoensis and Kalanchoe × houghtonii. The leaves of Kalanchoe laetivirens are completely green, while Kalanchoe daigremontiana has bands or spots on the back of leaves. The leaves of Kalanchoe delagoensis are linear, while Kalanchoe daigremontiana has lanceolate, oblong, ovate or triangular leaves. Kalanchoe × houghtonii is a hybrid between Kalanchoe daigremontiana and Kalanchoe delagoensis, therefore has characteristics in between; its leaves are narrower than those of Kalanchoe daigremontiana and its leaf base is attenuate, cuneate to weakly cordate or auriculate, while Kalanchoe daigremontiana has strongly cordate to auriculate or even peltate leaves.

154,Kalanchoe pinnata,"Kalanchoe pinnata, commonly known as cathedral bells, air plant, life plant, miracle leaf,,and love bush, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is a popular houseplant and has become naturalized in tropical and subtropical areas. The species is distinctive for the profusion of miniature plantlets that form on the margins of its leaves, a trait it has in common with some other members of Bryophyllum (now included in Kalanchoe).
It is a succulent, perennial plant, about 1 m (39 in) tall, with fleshy cylindrical stems and young growth of a reddish tinge, which can be found in flower throughout most of the year.","In temperate regions, Kalanchoe pinnata is grown as an indoor ornamental plant. Like most succulents, it cannot survive hard frost and will not thrive in environments in which the temperature drops below 10 °C (50 °F). It favours well-drained soil, the roots being otherwise susceptible to rot. In the tropics, K. pinnata is grown outdoors in gardens, from which it may escape to become naturalised - often as an invasive weed.",No data available
155,Kishu mikan,"The kishu mikan (Citrus kinokuni ex Tanaka), from Japanese Kishū mikan (紀州蜜柑), is a hybrid variety of mikan, or mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), found in Southern China and also grown in Japan.
The fruit is also known as Baby Mandarin, Tiny Tangerine, Mini Mandarin and Kishu Mandarin. It is sold under the brand name ""Cherry Orange"" in Europe. It is shaped like a mandarin, between 25 and 50 mm (0.98 and 1.97 in) in diameter. The fruit's orange skin is thin and smooth.
Some varieties of kishu, such as the mukaku kishu, are seedless. The species is used in creating seedless hybrid citrus. The largest variety is the hira kishu.","Kishu mandarin trees are commonly planted in household gardens in Japan, and grown in greenhouses, pots on balconies, sunny rooms, and commercial orchards.
They are small evergreen and perennial trees; they can live for centuries. Trees are often sold when about knee-high. They grow rapidly to a size of about 4 feet (1.2 meters) in diameter and 10 feet (3.0 m) in height (in pots, shorter: 7–8 ft or 2.1–2.4 m).

The trees flower abundantly in spring, around April in the northern hemisphere. Trees are self-fertile; manual transfer of pollen between blossoms (even just by shaking the branches) can improve yield. Trees thrive in high humidity but require well-drained soil. They require five hours of sun each day and will grow well and fruit in temperatures ranging from 55–75 °F (13–24 °C). If grown in containers, they can be taken indoors at night. 
There is some disagreement about their degree of cold-hardiness. They are moderately cold-hardy citrus, but it is said of the seedless mukakukishu variety that trees should be taken indoors or wrapped in a frost cloth when temperatures fall below either freezing, or 20 °F (−7 °C). It is said of the same variety that they are cold-hardy down to 5 °C (41 °F) or −10 °F (−23 °C). It is said that it can be grown in patio pots in hardiness zone 4-11, and in zones 8-11 outdoors, or in zones 3-11 patio and 8-11 outdoors, or in zones 9-10. Kishu mikan trees may be grafted onto various rootstocks. Rootstock hardiness may affect tree hardiness.

The fruit grows to 1–2 in (25–51 mm) in size and is harvested in mid-winter; in the Northern Hemisphere, this is November to February, depending on the local climate. Trees may fruit in their first year and typically yield 88 lb (40 kg) of fruit annually.
When the fruit is left on the tree for too long, it can lose its flavor, with the fruit becoming puffy and losing its acidity. Older trees may produce smaller fruits.
The fruit needs to be handled with care to avoid damage; it is usually picked by hand. Its small size makes harvesting and sorting it more labour-intensive per unit weight.",No data available
156,Kumara plicatilis,"Kumara plicatilis, formerly Aloe plicatilis, the fan-aloe, is a succulent plant endemic to a few mountains in the Fynbos ecoregion, of the Western Cape in South Africa. The plant has an unusual and striking fan-like arrangement of its leaves. It may grow as a large multistemmed shrub or as a small tree. It is one of the two species in the genus Kumara.","Kumara plicatilis is an attractive and interesting accent plant to have in a sunny garden. As such it is increasingly used as an ornamental plant for drought tolerant landscaping and rockeries. However it grows very slowly and consequently, outside of its natural habitat, it is often in danger of being overgrown, smothered and killed by faster growing plants in its vicinity.

159,Maranta leuconeura,"Maranta leuconeura, widely known as the prayer plant due to its daily sunlight-dependent movements (which are said to resemble hands “in-prayer”), is a species of flowering plant in the family Marantaceae native to the Brazilian tropical forests. It is a variable, rhizomatous perennial, growing to 30 cm (12 in) tall and broad, with crowded clumps of evergreen, strikingly-marked oval leaves, each up to 12 cm (5 in) long. The plant spreads itself horizontally, carpeting an entire small area of forest floor, sending roots into the substrate at each leaf node.
Maranta, in-addition to fellow “prayer-plant” genera (like Calathea,  Ctenanthe,  Goeppertia and Stromanthe), is closely related to such groups as Alpinia,  Ensete, Canna,  Curcuma, Heliconia,  Musa and  Zingiber.","Maranta leuconeura is a well-known houseplant in temperate regions, requiring a minimum temperature of 15 °C (59 °F). As a plant that is native to rainforests, Maranta prefers bright indirect sunlight, high humidity, and well-drained soil that has a high humus content. Acidic, clay or loam soils are tolerable.
Direct sunlight should be avoided, as well as standing water. At daytime the ideal temperature is 21–27 °C and at night 16–21 °C; the night temperature should not be lower than 15 °C. Higher temperatures also require higher humidity, for example, just spraying.
During the growing season, spring and summer, Maranta houseplants require moist soil and fertilization every month. Slightly drier soils and reduced fertilizer application are recommended for the remainder of the year. In warmer climates, at USDA Zones 10b-11, it can be grown as groundcover in moist, shady areas.",No data available
160,Mimosa pudica,"Mimosa pudica (also called sensitive plant, sleepy grass, sleepy plant, action plant, humble plant, touch-me-not, touch-and-die, or shameplant) is a creeping annual or perennial flowering plant of the pea/legume family Fabaceae. It is often grown for its curiosity value: the sensitive compound leaves quickly fold inward and droop when touched or shaken and re-open a few minutes later. For this reason, this species is commonly cited as an example of rapid plant movement. Like a number of other plant species, it undergoes changes in leaf orientation termed ""sleep"" or nyctinastic movement. The foliage closes during darkness and reopens in light. This was first studied by French scientist Jean-Jacques d'Ortous. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.
The species is native to the Caribbean and South and Central America, but is now a pantropical weed, and can now be found in the Southern United States, South Asia, East Asia, Micronesia, Australia, South Africa, and West Africa as well. It is not shade-tolerant and is primarily found on soils with low nutrient concentrations.

","In cultivation, this plant is most often grown as an indoor short lived perennial but is also grown for groundcover. Propagation is generally by seed. Germination should take place in 2-3 weeks. Mimosa pudica grows most effectively in nutrient-poor soil that allows for substantial water drainage. However, this plant is also shown to grow in scalped and eroded subsoils. Typically, disrupted soil is necessary in order for M. pudica to become established in an area. Additionally, the plant is shade intolerant and frost-sensitive, meaning that it does not tolerate low levels of light or cold temperatures. Mimosa pudica does not compete for resources with larger foliage or forest canopy undergrowth.
In temperate zones it must be grown under protection, where the temperature falls below 13 °C (55 °F).",No data available

The common name ""Swiss cheese plant"" is also used for the related species from the same genus, Monstera adansonii. The common name ""split-leaf philodendron"" is also used for the species Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum, although neither species is in the genus Philodendron.
Monstera deliciosa is native to tropical forests of southern Mexico, south to Panama. It has been introduced to many tropical areas, and has become a mildly invasive species in Hawaii, Seychelles, Ascension Island and the Society Islands. It is very widely grown in temperate zones as a houseplant. Although the plant contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals, which cause a needlelike sensation when touched, the ripe fruit is edible.","Monstera deliciosa is commonly grown outdoors as an ornamental plant in the tropics and subtropics. The plant requires a lot of space and a rich and loose soil (ideally garden soil and compost in equal parts). If it grows in the ground it is better to plant it near a tree, where it can climb, if not against a trellis. It is a ""moderately greedy plant,"" in that it needs to be watered just to keep the soil slightly moist. Its hardiness is 11 (that is to say the coldest at −1 °C or 30 °F). It cannot withstand these temperatures for more than a few hours, but it can live outside in certain temperate regions (Mediterranean coast, Brittany). A steady minimum temperature of at least 13–15 °C (55–59 °F) is preferable, allowing continuous growth. Growth ceases below 10 °C (50 °F) and it is killed by frost. It needs very bright exposure, but not full sun.
Forcing a M. deliciosa to flower outside of its typical tropical habitat proves to be difficult. Specific conditions need to be met for the plant to flower. However, in its tropical and subtropical habitat, the plant flowers easily. In ideal conditions it flowers about three years after planting. The plant can be propagated by taking cuttings of a mature plant or by air layering.","Monstera deliciosa is moderately toxic to both cats and dogs because it contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals (needle-like). This crystal may cause injury to the mouth, tongue, and digestive tract. It also causes dermatitis by direct contact with cat and dog skin."
165,Nephrolepis exaltata,"Nephrolepis exaltata, known as the sword fern or  Boston fern, is a species of fern in the family Nephrolepidaceae. It is native to the Americas.

It is also known as the Boston sword fern, wild Boston fern, Boston blue bell fern, tuber ladder fern, or fishbone fern.

","Nephrolepis exaltata is a very popular house plant, often grown in hanging baskets or similar conditions. It is a perennial plant hardy in USDA plant hardiness zones 9–11. Although the fern may appear totally dead during periods of frost, it will re-emerge in the spring. In general, the Boston fern thrives in damp, but not soggy, soil that is rich in nutrients. Of the common cultivated ferns, the Boston fern is the most tolerant to drought. The fern is acclimated to humid conditions, so when grown as a house plant, it is necessary to mist the plant when relative humidity falls below around 80%. Although the plant prefers partial shade or full shade outdoors, it doesn't grow in shade when indoors and responds best to bright filtered light.

173,Peperomia griseoargentea,"Peperomia is one of the two large genera of the family Piperaceae. It is estimated that there are at least over 1,000 species, occurring in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They are concentrated in South and Central America, but may also be found in southern North America, the Caribbean islands, Africa, Oceania, and southern and eastern parts of Asia. The exact number of species is difficult to determine, as some plants have been recorded several times with different names, and new species continue to be discovered. Peperomias have adapted to many different environments and their appearances vary greatly. Some are epiphytes (growing on other plants) or lithophytes (growing on rock or in rock crevices), and many are xerophytes (drought-tolerant, with thick succulent structures to save water) or possess underground tubers (geophytes). Most species are compact perennial shrubs or vines.
Some Peperomias have thick, waxy, succulent leaves and stems; still, others are rather delicate, with paper-thin leaves. Many species will easily sunburn, preferring filtered or indirect, bright sunlight. Most of the Peperomias have minimal to virtually non-existent root systems (species-depending), with the entire mass often being nothing more than a collection of tiny, hair-like appendages used to anchor the plant. These roots, while delicate, also enable the plants to survive in less-than-ideal conditions; however, their fragility also places them at a greater risk for root rot if water does not drain sufficiently quickly.
The genus name Peperomia was coined by Spanish botanists Ruiz López and Pavón Jiménez in 1794 after their travels in Peru and Chile. Peperomia plants do not have a widely- accepted common name, and some argue that it is better to use the genus name, as is the case with genera such as Petunia and Begonia. They are sometimes called radiator plants, a name possibly coined by L.H. Bailey because many of them enjoy bright and dry environments similar to a windowsill above a radiator. Furthermore, many individuals simply refer to the many Peperomias by their individual nicknames, such as Peperomia polybotrya being called the “Raindrop Peperomia” (due to its large, drop-shaped leaves), or P. argyreia being the “Watermelon Peperomia”, due to its leaf veining and shape resembling the look of a watermelon.

186,Philodendron hederaceum,"Philodendron hederaceum,  the heartleaf philodendron (syn. Philodendron scandens) is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae, native to Central America and the Caribbean which is common in the houseplant trade. Philodendron hederaceum var. hederaceum, the ""velvet philodendron,"" is a subspecies which is in the houseplant trade under its previous name of Philodendron micans. While toxic under certain conditions, it is also under current review for numerous health benefits.",No data available,"Parts of the plant are known to contain calcium oxalate crystals in varying concentrations. When ingested in large quantities, P. hederaceum cannot be properly digested. These calcium oxalate crystals are deposited in organs such as the kidneys, and can cause cardiac-related issues in humans  Although the plant is known to be toxic to mice and rats, the current literature is conflicting with regards to its toxicity in cats.
Although Philodendron species can be harmful if ingested, they also have a reputation of being a source of potential therapeutic applications for medical research. This reputation is due to the presence of terpenoids and flavonoids, natural compounds that are of interest because of their biological abilities in acting as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and disease preventative.
According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Philodendron hederaceum can cause oral irritation, a painful and swollen mouth, lips, and tongue, drooling, vomiting (except in horses), and difficulty swallowing in animals."

191,Pilea cadierei,"Pilea cadierei (or the aluminium plant or watermelon pilea) is a species of flowering plant in the nettle family Urticaceae. The species is endemic to the southern Chinese provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan, as well as Vietnam. The specific epithet cadierei refers to the 20th-century botanist R.P. Cadière. P. cadierei has earned the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit for its hardiness and reliability as a houseplant. In warmer countries, usually within USDA zones 8-12, the plant may be grown outside year-round as a perennial, either in-ground or contained, and pruned about 50% during the autumn (or whenever blooming concludes).

","With a minimum temperature of 15 °C (59 °F), it is cultivated as a houseplant in temperate regions due to its decorative leaves and easy vegetative propagation through cuttings. This plant is nontoxic to cats, dogs, and horses, and so is safe to have around pets.",No data available
192,Pilea peperomioides,"Pilea peperomioides (), the Chinese money plant, UFO plant, pancake plant, lefse plant or missionary plant, is a species of flowering plant in the nettle family Urticaceae, native to Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in southern China.","In temperate regions, P. peperomioides is treated as a houseplant, with cultivation recommended at a minimum temperature anywhere from 13 °C (55 °F) to 5 °C (41 °F). However, in its native range, the plant tolerates periods near or below freezing.  Thus the plant could be kept in unheated indoor areas or even outdoors in temperate climates; the foliage may be killed back by frost, but regrows in spring.  Wessel Marais, the Kew Gardens botanist who determined the identity of the plant in the 1980s, later grew the plant outdoors in Cazillac, France.  He reported it surviving for 6 or 7 years with temperatures as low as −9 °C (16 °F), noting that ""the stems above ground are killed but it comes again from below ground-level, so deep planting should do the trick"".
P. peperomioides is propagated from plantlets that sprout on the trunk of the parent plant (these are called offshoots) or from underground shoots (called rhizomes). These offshoots are often passed on as a lucky plant (""lucky thaler"") or friendship plant. Since constant temperatures and high humidity have a positive effect on plant growth, this plant species is suitable for planting terrariums.
Although the plant is endangered in its native habitat, it is among the most popular houseplants today. It is in high demand because it is slim, easy to grow, and tolerates dry environments. The plant is readily available in retail greenhouses, which in turn are supplied by industrial-scale farming enterprises.
This species has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

194,Platycerium superbum,"Platycerium is a genus of about 18 fern species in the polypod family, Polypodiaceae. Ferns in this genus are widely known as staghorn or elkhorn ferns due to their uniquely shaped fronds. This genus is epiphytic and is native to tropical and temperate areas of South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Guinea.","The species Platycerium bifurcatum and Platycerium superbum are commonly cultivated as ornamental plants. These oddly shaped ferns grow on trees and rocks and can be found in gardens, especially tropical gardens.
Staghorns can be propagated by spores produced on the underside of the fertile fronds. Colonial Platycerium can also be vegetatively propagated by carefully dividing large healthy ones into smaller, separate plants. These new plants can then be attached to board mounts or be strapped to trees until they take to the tree themselves.
