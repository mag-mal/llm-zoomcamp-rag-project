"{'id': 155, 'question': 'How does the cultivation method differ for Kishu mikan trees grown in containers compared to those planted in the ground?'}","**In containers**  
- Grow in pots, patio or balcony pots.  
- The tree is kept in a pot (shorter height, 7–8 ft vs 10 ft when in the ground).  
- It must be placed in well‑drained potting mix and kept in a sunny spot (5 h sun/day).  
- At night, the pot may be brought indoors (or wrapped in a frost cloth) because containers can lose heat more quickly.  
- Containers need more frequent watering and attention to drainage and humidity.

**In the ground**  
- The tree is planted directly in the soil of a garden or orchard.  
- It receives the same five‑hour sun requirement and well‑drained soil, but stays outdoors year‑round.  
- No need to move the tree indoors; it can be left outside as long as temperatures stay within its 55–75 °F range.  

Thus the main differences are the need to relocate or protect container trees at night and the use of potting versus garden soil.","{'Relevance': 'RELEVANT', 'Explanation': 'The answer directly compares cultivation practices for Kishu mikan trees in containers versus those planted in the ground, covering differences in pot size, soil type, watering, sun exposure, and nighttime protection, which directly addresses the question.'}",155,How does the cultivation method differ for Kishu mikan trees grown in containers compared to those planted in the ground?,RELEVANT,"The answer directly compares cultivation practices for Kishu mikan trees in containers versus those planted in the ground, covering differences in pot size, soil type, watering, sun exposure, and nighttime protection, which directly addresses the question."

| **Soil type** | Use a well‑drained mix that stays moist but never water‑logged. A typical houseplant mix (e.g., peat‑based with added perlite or coarse sand) works well. |
| **Moisture level** | Keep the soil consistently moist—dry to the touch only between waterings. The soil should never stay soggy, so make sure the pot has drainage holes. |
| **pH** | Aim for a neutral to slightly acidic pH of **6.1 – 7.3**. |
| **Watering frequency** | Water whenever the surface layer dries out (usually once a week in warmer indoor conditions). Avoid letting the pot sit in standing water; if water accumulates in the tray, pour it out within ~15–30 minutes. |

* The fern can also be started from spores, but this is far less common.

**Conditions for Successful Growth**

1. **Light** – low indirect light to deep shade (outdoors) or shaded indoor location.  
2. **Moisture** – keep the substrate evenly moist but **never let it sit in standing water**.  
3. **Drainage & Aeration** – the substrate must allow good drainage and aeration while retaining enough moisture.  
4. **Soil/Substrate** – the fern is indifferent to soil type; coconut fiber, sphagnum moss, or other well‑aerated mixes are ideal.  
5. **Watering** – regular moisture, no prolonged drying.

That means the plant lives for more than two years, surviving from season to season rather than completing its life cycle in a single growing season like an annual.  

Because it is perennial, Englerarum regrows each year from the same root system or rhizome, allowing it to produce new leaves and flowers each season. Its life cycle therefore consists of a yearly cycle of vegetative growth (leaves and stems), flowering, and then a period of rest or dormancy, before the cycle repeats the next year.","{'Relevance': 'PARTLY_RELEVANT', 'Explanation': ""The answer correctly explains what a perennial plant is and outlines the general growth cycle of Englerarum, addressing the second part of the question.

- **Light**: Provide as much light as possible, especially during **September‑November**, when the light intensity should be highest.  
- **Medium & potting**: Use a coarse, non‑constricting medium such as fir bark, crock, or charcoal. Plant it in a basket or large pot so the roots are rarely disturbed.  
- **Root care**: Mature plants have sensitive roots; avoid repotting or disturbing the roots, as this can delay flowering or even kill the plant.
