The numerous hybrids are propagated mainly by grafting on to seedling rootstock.

The specific epithet aethiopicum in this sense was the Latin term for Africa south of the then known world, that is to say, more or less Africa south of Egypt.\\nIn South Africa the species occurs widely, though not generally profusely, mainly on moist sandstone cliffs in full shade. In the Cape Peninsula it is uncommon and grows mainly at the highest locally available altitudes, generally about 600–1,085 m (2,000–3,600 ft).\\nAdiantum aethiopicum grows in spreading clumps of fronds from 10 to 45 cm (4 to 18 in) in height. The rhizomes are wiry and branched. The fronds are horizontal and layered, or upright. They are divided into two or three and have many small wedge-shaped segments, each of which has sori along its margins underneath.\\nA common plant, often seen growing in moist areas. In Australia it is found near by creeks or in open forest, where it may form a large colony.\\nThe 1889 book \\'The Useful Native Plants of Australia’ records that \"This plant is said to possess medicinal properties, being\\nslightly astringent and emetic. It has been used in Europe in making \"Sirop de Capt\\'llaire,\" a demulcent drink, employed in\\ndiseases of the chest.\"',\n",

It should be grown in soil rich in organic matter and should be watered frequently but lightly, to keep the roots damp but not drenched. The temperature should not fall below 12 °C (54 °F).

It was one of the many species authored by Scottish botanist Robert Brown, appearing in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. Its species name is the Latin adjective formosus \"handsome\" or \"beautiful\".\\nAdiantum formosum is an attractive plant, with fronds up to 120 cm (48 in) high. The rhizome of this species is unusually deep, up to 60 cm (24 in) below into the earth. The stems are black and can reach 90 cm (36 in) in length, while the fronds or blades are triangular with rectangular segments. The last segment of the frond is irregular and asymmetrical, on a short stem. This maidenhair fern can grow to 2 metres (7 ft) tall. The smallest segments of the fronds are the pinnules, which are wedge-shaped, rectangular or trapezoid. They have 1–10 sori along the margins underneath.\\nAdiantum formosum is found in Queensland, and New South Wales, and into Victoria, where it is less common. It also occurs in New Zealand. It is often seen growing in moist areas or along streams usually on alluvial soils,  Adiantum formosum is generally found in rainforest or in nearby open eucalyptus forest, where it may form a large colony.\\nEasy to grow in cultivation, Adiantum formosum makes a good subject for container gardening. It appears to go dormant in cooler months and grow rapidly during the summer. A smaller, variegated form is commercially available and cultivated.\\n\\n',\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "cultivation: Aechmea fasciata requires partial shade to bright indirect light, and can handle brief periods of early morning sunlight, but should be shielded from the sun during the hottest parts of the day. Excessive sun exposure will cause burning on the foliage and dehydration of the plant; comparatively, reduced sunlight or darker conditions will prevent the plant's characteristic coloration and striping from developing fully, instead reverting to a deeper hue of pastel-green/teal-blue in an effort to photosynthesize effectively in the shade. Less bright indirect light will also limit flowering. As with all bromeliads and epiphytes, Aechmea fasciata requires adequate airflow around the entire plant to stay fresh. \n",
      "Over time, the plant’s roots will adhere to the surface provided, and the plant will form a small colony. The gardener simply keeps the \"cup\" or funnels filled with water. This method of cultivation is mostly executed successfully outdoors, rather than indoors, and is best-achieved in appropriate climates, especially maritime or seaside locations where the bromeliad may absorb moisture via fog and marine layer.\n",
      "toxicity: Aechmea fasciata, while not lethally poisonous, is listed in the FDA Poisonous Plant Database under the section \"skin-irritating substances in plants\". As bromeliads naturally produce the enzyme and alkaloid bromelain—commonly extracted from pineapples (also a bromeliad) as a supplement and digestive enzyme—, skin contact with the plant's sharp, serrated leaf margins is known to cause contact dermititis, phytophotodermatitis, and contact allergy; typical side effects are a mild, itchy sensation or redness. Therefore leather gloves are recommended when working with bromeliads, for example, arm-length or rose-pruning gloves.\n",
