The rhizome of this species is unusually deep, up to 60 cm (24 in) below into the earth. The stems are black and can reach 90 cm (36 in) in length, while the fronds or blades are triangular with rectangular segments. The last segment of the frond is irregular and asymmetrical, on a short stem. This maidenhair fern can grow to 2 metres (7 ft) tall. The smallest segments of the fronds are the pinnules, which are wedge-shaped, rectangular or trapezoid. They have 1–10 sori along the margins underneath.\\nAdiantum formosum is found in Queensland, and New South Wales, and into Victoria, where it is less common. It also occurs in New Zealand. It is often seen growing in moist areas or along streams usually on alluvial soils,  Adiantum formosum is generally found in rainforest or in nearby open eucalyptus forest, where it may form a large colony.\\nEasy to grow in cultivation, Adiantum formosum makes a good subject for container gardening.

Less bright indirect light will also limit flowering. As with all bromeliads and epiphytes, Aechmea fasciata requires adequate airflow around the entire plant to stay fresh. \\nOver time, the plant’s roots will adhere to the surface provided, and the plant will form a small colony.

       "  'summary': \"Angraecum sesquipedale (), also known as Darwin's orchid, Christmas orchid, Star of Bethlehem orchid, and king of the angraecums, is an epiphytic orchid in the genus Angraecum endemic to Madagascar. The orchid was first discovered by the French botanist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars in 1798, but was not described until 1822. It is noteworthy for its long spur and its association with the naturalist Charles Darwin, who surmised that the flower was pollinated by a then undiscovered moth with a proboscis whose length was unprecedented at the time. Darwin's prediction went unverified for 21 years after his death, until just such a moth was discovered and his conjecture vindicated. The story of its postulated pollinator has come to be seen as one of the celebrated predictions of the theory of evolution.\",\n",
       "  'cultivation': \"Angraecum sesquipedale was first brought to the United Kingdom in 1855 to be grown outside of its natural environment by William Ellis. Subsequently, Ellis achieved the first flowering of the plant in cultivation in 1857. Angraecum sesquipedale has been attributed as having a nicer appearance when grown in cultivation than when found in the wild, since wild specimens appear as a long stem surrounded by a few struggling leaves. Additionally, A. sesquipedale is seldom grown in private collections, despite its enormous importance to Darwin's concept of coevolution and subsequently the fields of botany and evolutionary biology.\\n\\nIt is often recommended that A. sesquipedale be grown under warm to intermediate conditions and given as much light as possible without burning the leaves. The choice of growing the plant in intermediate or warm housing conditions can affect the timing of the flowering. In order to stimulate heavy flower production it is important that the light intensity be greatest between September and November. The number of flower spikes present during flowering is dependent on the number of new leaf-pairs formed during the preceding spring and summer, since each newly formed leaf-pair produce one spike and rarely two. Angraecum sesquipedale is commonly found to have a slow growth habit, but the orchid can be expected to produce flowers even before it has reached an adult size. Angraecum sesquipedale is notorious for having sensitive roots. The roots of mature plants are best left undisturbed as much as possible and as a result it is prudent to be especially careful during repotting. Young plants however are less susceptible to such root problems. Disturbing the roots can cause the plant to sulk for two to four years or even to cause it to die. When a mature plant is disturbed it frequently loses many of its lower leaves and reverts to only producing one or two flowers at a time. To avoid these problems it is commonly advised that the orchid be planted in a coarse medium such as fir bark, crock, or charcoal to minimize disturbances to the roots. Also planting it in a basket or large pot is best since this allows the orchid to grow for many years before having to have its roots disturbed.\",\n",

Croton variegatum L.) is a species of Codiaeum, a genus of flowering plants, in the  Euphorbiaceae (the spurge family). Initially described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, it is native to Australasia and Oceania, from Malaysia and Indonesia in the north through northeastern Australia, as well as many Southeast Asian and South Pacific islands, growing in open forests and scrub. \\nThe Codiaeums\\' commonly used name of \"croton\" should not be confused with Croton, a separate genus—also within the Euphorbiaceae—which contains more than 700 species of cosmopolitan herbs, shrubs, and trees.',\n",
       "  'cultivation': 'In tropical climates, crotons make attractive hedges and potted patio specimens, valued for their striking foliage. They only survive outdoors where temperatures do not normally drop below 10 to 13 °C (50 to 55 °F) in winter; colder temperatures can cause leaf loss. In colder climates, the plants are grown in greenhouses or as house plants. The cultivated garden crotons are usually smaller than the wild plant, rarely over 1.8 m (5.9 ft) tall, and occur in a wide diversity of leaf shapes and colours. They are sometimes grouped under the name Codiaeum variegatum var. pictum (Lodd.) Müll. Arg., though this is not botanically distinct from the species and usually treated as a synonym of it.',\n",
       "  'toxicity': 'As with the majority of the spurges, when broken or cut, every part of C. variegatum will \"bleed\" and drip a milky, caustic sap, eventually drying into a latex-like consistency. Care must be taken to avoid touching this latex, such as only handling the plant while wearing sufficiently protective gloves, as well as eye goggles or sunglasses. Generally, small, inadvertent drops of the sap on one\\'s hands or skin will cause no ill effect in the majority of the population, provided it is promptly washed off using soapy, warm water—this may even be followed with the use of a hand sanitizer or even a mildly diluted isopropyl alcohol. However, direct contact between the sap of Euphorbiaceae and the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, genitals, or any open wound, is strongly discouraged and may result in unknown side effects. Complications stemming from sap contact may range from mild to extreme burning pain, itchiness, rash or temporary dulling of the senses; depending on the region of the body affected, this sensory reaction may include temporary or long-term complications with sight, hearing, taste, feeling or smell, among other issues. In certain sensitive-skinned individuals, contact with small amounts of the sap can cause contact dermatitis. The entire plant, including its bark, roots, inflorescences and foliage, is poisonous. The primary alkaloid present is the chemical compound 5-desoxyingenol.  The plant contains an oil which is violently purgative and a suspected carcinogen.  Consumption of the seeds can be fatal to children and even adults.'},\n",

       "  'summary': 'Fittonia (or nerve plant or mosaic plant) is a genus of evergreen perennial flowering plants in the acanthus (\\'bear’s britches\\') family, Acanthaceae. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical forested areas in northern and western South America, mainly Perú.\\nThe most commonly cultivated species is F. albivenis and its range of  cultivars. They are low-lying, forest floor plants, typically only growing between 10–15 cm (4–6 in) tall, without the 5-10 cm (1-4 in) tall flower stalks. The main feature of the species is its lush, green foliage, streaked with veins of white to deep pink, depending on cultivar; this veining earns the plant its common name of \\'Nerve-Plant\\', as the \"network\" of vessels appears to resemble the layout of a nervous system. The plants also possess a short fuzz on their stems, like other acanthus family genera. Small buds may appear after a time where the stem splits into leaves. \\nWith a spreading growth habit making it ideal as a shaded garden groundcover, Fittonia can easily be propagated by taking cuttings or by pruning the growing tips. These fresh clippings will regrow roots simply by placing the cut ends in a vessel of water in a bright, albeit indirectly-lit, location. Optionally, this method of \"water-propagation\" may be avoided altogether, as most cuttings may be placed directly into moist substrate, such as sphagnum moss, perlite, coconut (coco) fiber, well-aerated soil, or even LECA (hydroton clay balls). As most plant species will do after being pruned, the trimmed section(s) of the mother plant will be triggered to grow new leaves in a matter of weeks. \\nThe flowers are rather small, appearing on angular-sided bloom spikes, with a white to off-white colour. Fittonia inflorescences are quite reminiscent of those of the related genus Hypoestes (polka-dot plants); additionally, like the Hypoestes, Fittonia are best kept in a moist area with mild, indirect but bright sunlight, or under screening outdoors in appropriate climates. They thrive in ambient temperatures above 55 °F (13 °C), thus, in temperate areas, they must be grown as houseplants. Notoriously thirsty plants, Fittonia (and Hypoestes) are known to \"faint\" or wilt when the top layer of substrate begins to dry, but is quickly revived with watering. The plants respond especially well to \"bottom watering\", or by submerging a potted specimen in a tray of water instead of pouring water from above. This has the added benefit of keeping the leaves free of water droplets or splashed dirt, which could both lead to fungal infections, such as powdery mildew.\\n\\n',\n",

The exact number of species is difficult to determine, as some plants have been recorded several times with different names, and new species continue to be discovered. Peperomias have adapted to many different environments and their appearances vary greatly. Some are epiphytes (growing on other plants) or lithophytes (growing on rock or in rock crevices), and many are xerophytes (drought-tolerant, with thick succulent structures to save water) or possess underground tubers (geophytes). Most species are compact perennial shrubs or vines.\\nSome Peperomias have thick, waxy, succulent leaves and stems; still, others are rather delicate, with paper-thin leaves. Many species will easily sunburn, preferring filtered or indirect, bright sunlight. Most of the Peperomias have minimal to virtually non-existent root systems (species-depending), with the entire mass often being nothing more than a collection of tiny, hair-like appendages used to anchor the plant. These roots, while delicate, also enable the plants to survive in less-than-ideal conditions; however, their fragility also places them at a greater risk for root rot if water does not drain sufficiently quickly.\\nThe genus name Peperomia was coined by Spanish botanists Ruiz López and Pavón Jiménez in 1794 after their travels in Peru and Chile. Peperomia plants do not have a widely- accepted common name, and some argue that it is better to use the genus name, as is the case with genera such as Petunia and Begonia. They are sometimes called radiator plants, a name possibly coined by L.H. Bailey because many of them enjoy bright and dry environments similar to a windowsill above a radiator. Furthermore, many individuals simply refer to the many Peperomias by their individual nicknames, such as Peperomia polybotrya being called the “Raindrop Peperomia” (due to its large, drop-shaped leaves), or P. argyreia being the “Watermelon Peperomia”, due to its leaf veining and shape resembling the look of a watermelon.\\n\\n',\n",

Thus the plant could be kept in unheated indoor areas or even outdoors in temperate climates; the foliage may be killed back by frost, but regrows in spring.  Wessel Marais, the Kew Gardens botanist who determined the identity of the plant in the 1980s, later grew the plant outdoors in Cazillac, France.  He reported it surviving for 6 or 7 years with temperatures as low as −9 °C (16 °F), noting that \"the stems above ground are killed but it comes again from below ground-level, so deep planting should do the trick\".\\nP. peperomioides is propagated from plantlets that sprout on the trunk of the parent plant (these are called offshoots) or from underground shoots (called rhizomes). These offshoots are often passed on as a lucky plant (\"lucky thaler\") or friendship plant. Since constant temperatures and high humidity have a positive effect on plant growth, this plant species is suitable for planting terrariums.\\nAlthough the plant is endangered in its native habitat, it is among the most popular houseplants today.
