      "CONTEXT:\n",
      "Plant: Philodendron hederaceum\n",
      "Summary: Philodendron hederaceum,  the heartleaf philodendron (syn. Philodendron scandens) is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae, native to Central America and the Caribbean which is common in the houseplant trade. Philodendron hederaceum var. hederaceum, the \"velvet philodendron,\" is a subspecies which is in the houseplant trade under its previous name of Philodendron micans. While toxic under certain conditions, it is also under current review for numerous health benefits.\n",
      "Cultivation: No data available\n",
      "Toxicity: Parts of the plant are known to contain calcium oxalate crystals in varying concentrations. When ingested in large quantities, P. hederaceum cannot be properly digested. These calcium oxalate crystals are deposited in organs such as the kidneys, and can cause cardiac-related issues in humans  Although the plant is known to be toxic to mice and rats, the current literature is conflicting with regards to its toxicity in cats.\n",
      "Although Philodendron species can be harmful if ingested, they also have a reputation of being a source of potential therapeutic applications for medical research. This reputation is due to the presence of terpenoids and flavonoids, natural compounds that are of interest because of their biological abilities in acting as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and disease preventative.\n",
      "According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Philodendron hederaceum can cause oral irritation, a painful and swollen mouth, lips, and tongue, drooling, vomiting (except in horses), and difficulty swallowing in animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plant: Anthurium clarinervium\n",
      "Summary: Anthurium (; Schott, 1829) is a genus of about 1,000 species of flowering plants, the largest genus of the arum family, Araceae. General common names include anthurium, tailflower, flamingo flower, pigtail plant, and laceleaf.\n",
      "The genus is native to the Americas, where it is distributed from northern Mexico to northern Argentina and parts of the Caribbean.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cultivation: Like other aroids, many species of Anthurium plant can be grown as houseplants, or outdoors in mild climates in shady spots, including Anthurium crystallinum and Anthurium clarinervium with its large, velvety, dark green leaves and silvery white venation. Many hybrids are derived from Anthurium andraeanum or Anthurium scherzerianum because of their colorful spathes. They thrive in moist soils with high organic matter. In milder climates the plants can be grown in pots of soil. Indoors plants thrive at temperatures of 16–22 °C (61–72 °F) and at lower light than other house plants. Wiping the leaves off with water will remove any dust and insects. Plants in pots with good root systems will benefit from a weak fertilizer solution every other week.  In the case of vining or climbing Anthuriums, the plants benefit from being provided with a totem to climb.\n",
      "Toxicity: All plants within the Anthurium genus are toxic to cats, dogs, and even horses. Each part of the plant, including the root, stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds, poses a risk of toxicity. The plant contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause oral irritation, pain, swelling, excessive drooling, vomiting, and difficulty swallowing. Keeping these plants away from your pets (and equines) is the best way to prevent a medical emergency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plant: Crassula ovata\n",
      "Summary: Crassula ovata, commonly known as jade plant, lucky plant, money plant or money tree, is a succulent plant with small pink or white flowers that is native to the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa, and Mozambique; it is common as a houseplant worldwide. Much of its popularity stems from the low levels of care needed; the jade plant requires little water and can survive in most indoor conditions. It is sometimes referred to as the money tree; however, Pachira aquatica also has this nickname.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cultivation: As a succulent, Crassula ovata requires little water in the summer and even less in the winter. It is susceptible to overwatering, especially during the cold season. Watering excessively can cause leaf fall and root rot. However, a lack of water can also damage it. It should be grown in a porous substrate with good drainage, which will vary depending on the climate it is grown in. It requires four to six hours of direct sun or medium shade exposures with bright light per day. In regions with mild weather it can withstand some light frost provided that the substrate is kept dry.\n",
      "C. ovata may display a red tinge around its leaves when grown in bright sunlight. In more extreme cases the green colour of the plant is lost and may be replaced by yellow. This is caused by the jade plant making pigments such as carotenoids to protect it from harsh sunlight and ultraviolet rays. The plant also flowers in the winter, particularly during a cooler, darker, dry spell. C. ovata is sometimes attacked by mealybugs, a common nuisance of the succulents.\n",
      "Toxicity: Some sources claim that some species from the Crassulaceae family, including the jade plant, are toxic to horses, cats and dogs, as well as mildly toxic to humans with skin contact, but such claims remain unproven. Crassula ovata is known to be used as medicinal plant in some regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plant: Jatropha podagrica\n",
      "Summary: Jatropha podagrica is a species of flowering, caudiciform succulent plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, aligning it closely with related genera such as Croton, Euphorbia and Ricinus (castor bean), among others. It is native to the neotropics of Central America and southern Mexico, but is grown as an ornamental plant in many parts of the world due to its unusual appearance and mature caudex development. Common names for the species include gout-plant, gout-stalk, Guatemalan rhubarb, coral-plant, Buddha-belly plant, purging-nut, physic-nut, goutystalk nettlespurge, Australian bottleplant (a geographical misnomer) and tartogo.\n",
      "Cultivation: The swollen caudex, showy leaves, and colourful flowers make J. podagrica an attractive ornamental, and it is grown as an indoor plant in many parts of the world.\n",
      "Toxicity: All parts of the plant are considered toxic, in particular the seeds. The main toxins are a purgative oil and a phytotoxin or toxalbumin (curcin) similar to ricin in Ricinis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plant: Kalanchoe daigremontiana\n",
      "Summary: Kalanchoe daigremontiana, formerly known as Bryophyllum daigremontianum and commonly called mother of thousands, alligator plant or Mexican hat plant, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. Like other members of Bryophyllum (now included in the genus Kalanchoe), it can propagate vegetatively from plantlets that develop on its leaf margins, as well as through upshoots from lateral roots, and seeds. All parts of this species contain a very toxic steroid known as daigremontianin.\n",
      "It is often confused with Kalanchoe laetivirens, Kalanchoe delagoensis and Kalanchoe × houghtonii. The leaves of Kalanchoe laetivirens are completely green, while Kalanchoe daigremontiana has bands or spots on the back of leaves. The leaves of Kalanchoe delagoensis are linear, while Kalanchoe daigremontiana has lanceolate, oblong, ovate or triangular leaves. Kalanchoe × houghtonii is a hybrid between Kalanchoe daigremontiana and Kalanchoe delagoensis, therefore has characteristics in between; its leaves are narrower than those of Kalanchoe daigremontiana and its leaf base is attenuate, cuneate to weakly cordate or auriculate, while Kalanchoe daigremontiana has strongly cordate to auriculate or even peltate leaves.\n",

      "Summary: Jatropha podagrica is a species of flowering, caudiciform succulent plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, aligning it closely with related genera such as Croton, Euphorbia and Ricinus (castor bean), among others. It is native to the neotropics of Central America and southern Mexico, but is grown as an ornamental plant in many parts of the world due to its unusual appearance and mature caudex development. Common names for the species include gout-plant, gout-stalk, Guatemalan rhubarb, coral-plant, Buddha-belly plant, purging-nut, physic-nut, goutystalk nettlespurge, Australian bottleplant (a geographical misnomer) and tartogo.\n",
      "Cultivation: The swollen caudex, showy leaves, and colourful flowers make J. podagrica an attractive ornamental, and it is grown as an indoor plant in many parts of the world.\n",
      "Toxicity: All parts of the plant are considered toxic, in particular the seeds. The main toxins are a purgative oil and a phytotoxin or toxalbumin (curcin) similar to ricin in Ricinis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plant: Guzmania lingulata\n",
      "Summary: Guzmania lingulata, the droophead tufted airplant or scarlet star, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, subfamily Tillandsioideae. This evergreen epiphytic perennial is native to rainforest habitats in Central America, northern and central South America and southern Mexico. The Latin word lingulata means \"tongue-shaped\". The foliage grows in a star-shaped basal rosette culminating in an orange and red bracted inflorescence.  It is among the most commonly cultivated bromeliad types, with cultivars producing flowers in shades of maroon, red, orange, yellow or pink.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cultivation: Cat palms require high light for indoor house plants. The suggested minimum temperature is 4.5 °C (40.1 °F). They are particularly susceptible to dry soil, and water must be applied regularly. Fertilizer should be applied every one or two months.\n",

      "Summary: Dieffenbachia seguine, widely known as dumbcane, as well as leopard lily or tuftroot, is a species of Dieffenbachia, a flowering aroid plant of the family Araceae (the arums). It is native to the neotropical realm of the Americas, from extreme southern Mexico and Belize and much of Central America, as well as the northern half of South America (it is typically absent in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay). It is found on many Caribbean islands and territories, including Cuba, Grand Bahama, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Hispaniola, Îles des Saintes, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico, Saba, Saint Kitts and Trinidad and Tobago. D. seguine is also found on the Galápagos islands of Santa Cruz and San Cristóbal, where it was likely introduced by humans.\n",
      "Cultivation: Dieffenbachia seguine is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate shade gardens and as a potted house plant. Cultivars emphasize different patterns of variegation.\n",

      "Plant: Pilea peperomioides\n",
      "Summary: Pilea peperomioides (), the Chinese money plant, UFO plant, pancake plant, lefse plant or missionary plant, is a species of flowering plant in the nettle family Urticaceae, native to Yunnan and Sichuan provinces in southern China.\n",
      "Cultivation: In temperate regions, P. peperomioides is treated as a houseplant, with cultivation recommended at a minimum temperature anywhere from 13 °C (55 °F) to 5 °C (41 °F). However, in its native range, the plant tolerates periods near or below freezing.  Thus the plant could be kept in unheated indoor areas or even outdoors in temperate climates; the foliage may be killed back by frost, but regrows in spring.  Wessel Marais, the Kew Gardens botanist who determined the identity of the plant in the 1980s, later grew the plant outdoors in Cazillac, France.  He reported it surviving for 6 or 7 years with temperatures as low as −9 °C (16 °F), noting that \"the stems above ground are killed but it comes again from below ground-level, so deep planting should do the trick\".\n",
      "P. peperomioides is propagated from plantlets that sprout on the trunk of the parent plant (these are called offshoots) or from underground shoots (called rhizomes). These offshoots are often passed on as a lucky plant (\"lucky thaler\") or friendship plant. Since constant temperatures and high humidity have a positive effect on plant growth, this plant species is suitable for planting terrariums.\n",
      "Although the plant is endangered in its native habitat, it is among the most popular houseplants today. It is in high demand because it is slim, easy to grow, and tolerates dry environments. The plant is readily available in retail greenhouses, which in turn are supplied by industrial-scale farming enterprises.\n",
      "This species has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n",
      "There are three different cultivars which have appeared in the last few years “Sugar”, “White Splash” and “Mojito.”\n",

      "Plant: Dracaena reflexa\n",
      "Summary: Dracaena reflexa (commonly called song of India or song of Jamaica) is a tree native to Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, and other nearby islands of the Indian Ocean. It is widely grown as an ornamental plant and houseplant, valued for its richly coloured, evergreen leaves, and thick, irregular stems.\n",
      "Cultivation: Dracaena reflexa is a popular ornamental plant, both in the landscape and the home. It can be enjoyed as a specimen plant, accent, or pruned to create a border. Several cultivars have been selected, particularly variegated clones with cream and yellow-green margins. It performs well as a houseplant, tolerating infrequent waterings. It prefers bright, filtered light, without direct sun exposure, restricted outdoors to zones 10–11. It has average water needs and should be fertilized bi-weekly when actively growing. Although it can survive in relatively low light levels, the plant may grow spindly if given insufficient light. When grown indoors, temperatures of 18 to 25 °C (64 to 77 °F) should be maintained. It can be propagated via herbaceous stem cuttings.\n",
      "The cultivar Dracaena reflexa 'Variegata'  has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. (confirmed 2017)\n",
      "Traditional medicine practitioners of Madagascar have long believed Dracaena reflexa to cure malarial symptoms, poisoning, dysentery, diarrhea, dysmenorrhea, and to be useful as an antipyretic and hemostatic agent. The leaves and bark are mixed with parts of a number of other native plants and mixed into herbal teas. Its effectiveness in any such treatment remains unproven.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fruit of D. reflexa is also important to the diet of the Malagasy black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata variegata). The Frégate beetle (Polposipus herculeanus), an endangered species endemic to Frégate Island (Seychelles), is also known to associate with this plant.\n",

      "Plant: Dracaena angolensis\n",
      "Summary: Dracaena angolensis (synonym Sansevieria cylindrica), commonly known as African spear or the spear sansevieria, is a succulent plant native to Angola in Southern Africa. For years, it was placed within the genus Sansevieria (snake-plants), a specific name which is still used synonymously by some; in the 21st century, Sansevieria became part of Dracaena (dragon-trees), after improved testing methods, physical comparisons, and other analyses found sufficient commonalities between the two genera to warrant subsumption.\n",
      "The genus Dracaena is a part of the Asparagaceae (asparagus family)—i.e., they are closely aligned with and related to such groups as the Asparagus, Agave, Beaucarnea (ponytail \"palms\"), Chlorophytum (spider-plants), Camassia, Dasylirion (sotols), Hesperaloe (Texan or red yuccas) and Yucca (Joshua trees).\n",
      "Cultivation: The species is drought-tolerant and in cultivation requires water only about once every other week during the growing season. The species can be watered once a month during the winter months. The species was described by Wenceslas Bojer in 1837. Dracaena angolensis (under the synonym Sansevieria cylindrica) received its common name from a competition in a Dutch national newspaper. It is popular as an ornamental plant as it is easy to culture and take care of in a home if given bright sunlight and other required resources.  In Brazil, where it is known as lança de São Jorge (\"St. George's spear\"), it is grown outside houses to ward off evil that might harm the home. The plant plays an important part in the Afro-Brazilian syncretic religion Umbanda, representing the orisha Ogum, as Ogum is syncretized with St. George.\n",

      "Plant: Dracaena sanderiana\n",
      "Summary: Dracaena sanderiana is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae, native to Central Africa. It was named after the German–English gardener Henry Frederick Conrad Sander (1847–1920). The plant is commonly marketed as \"lucky bamboo,\" which has become one of its common names, although it is not a species of bamboo.\n",
      "Cultivation: Dracaena sanderiana and its related varieties are popular houseplants. It is a suitable plant for confined spaces, and it does very well in indirect sunlight or partial shade as direct sunlight often causes its leaves to burn or yellow. The ideal temperature range for D. sanderiana is from 16 to 27 °C (61 to 81 °F). It requires average warmth, adequate light, and regular watering with dry periods in between if planted in soil. It tolerates dry air, but because it is a tropical plant, it does best in higher humidity areas or when given regular mistings. When planted indoors, it stays a smaller, more compact size while growing upwards, leading to its bamboo-like appearance. In contrast, if planted in the ground, it loses its bamboo-like look and it would fill with a leaf-like shape like other dragon trees. When it comes to light, lucky bamboo prefers bright, filtered sunlight, such as what is found under a rainforest canopy. Avoid direct sunlight as it will scorch the leaves. It can be propagated by cutting a part of the stem just above a node (the \"rings\" around the plant's stem from which offshoots grow). Cuttings can be made year round.\n",

The leaves of Kalanchoe delagoensis are linear, while Kalanchoe daigremontiana has lanceolate, oblong, ovate or triangular leaves. Kalanchoe × houghtonii is a hybrid between Kalanchoe daigremontiana and Kalanchoe delagoensis, therefore has characteristics in between; its leaves are narrower than those of Kalanchoe daigremontiana and its leaf base is attenuate, cuneate to weakly cordate or auriculate, while Kalanchoe daigremontiana has strongly cordate to auriculate or even peltate leaves.\n",
